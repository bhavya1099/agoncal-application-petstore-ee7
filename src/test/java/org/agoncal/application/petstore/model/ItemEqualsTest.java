Scenario 1: Test to check if two identical items are equal

Details:
  TestName: testEqualsMethodWithIdenticalItems
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method functionality when two identical items are compared. The target scenario is when two items have the same name and description.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two identical Item objects with the same name and description.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on one of the Item objects, passing the other Item object as an argument.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is true.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies two identical items as equal. This test is significant in the context of comparing items in the application.

Scenario 2: Test to check if two different items are not equal

Details:
  TestName: testEqualsMethodWithDifferentItems
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method functionality when two different items are compared. The target scenario is when two items have different names or descriptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Item objects with different names or descriptions.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on one of the Item objects, passing the other Item object as an argument.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies two different items as not equal. This test is significant in the context of comparing items in the application.

Scenario 3: Test to check if an item is not equal to null

Details:
  TestName: testEqualsMethodWithNull
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method functionality when an item is compared with null. The target scenario is when the equals method is invoked on an Item object with null as an argument.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Item object.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on the Item object, passing null as an argument.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies that an item is not equal to null. This test is significant in the context of comparing items in the application.

Scenario 4: Test to check if an item is equal to itself

Details:
  TestName: testEqualsMethodWithItself
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method functionality when an item is compared with itself. The target scenario is when the equals method is invoked on an Item object with itself as an argument.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Item object.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on the Item object, passing itself as an argument.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is true.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies that an item is equal to itself. This test is significant in the context of comparing items in the application.

Scenario 5: Test to check if an item is not equal to an object of a different class

Details:
  TestName: testEqualsMethodWithDifferentClassObject
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method functionality when an item is compared with an object of a different class. The target scenario is when the equals method is invoked on an Item object with an object of a different class as an argument.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Item object and an object of a different class.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on the Item object, passing the object of a different class as an argument.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies that an item is not equal to an object of a different class. This test is significant in the context of comparing items in the application.
