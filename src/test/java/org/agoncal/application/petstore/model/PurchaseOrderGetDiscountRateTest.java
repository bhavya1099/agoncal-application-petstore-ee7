```
Scenario 1: Retrieve initial discount rate when not set

Details:
  TestName: getDefaultDiscountRate
  Description: Tests if the getDiscountRate method returns null when the discount rate is initially not set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of PurchaseOrder without setting the discount rate.
  Act: Call getDiscountRate method on the PurchaseOrder instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the method correctly returns a null value when the discount rate hasn't been explicitly set, which is expected behavior as the floating-point fields in newly instantiated objects are null by default. This test checks the method's accuracy in handling uninitialized values.

Scenario 2: Retrieve set discount rate value

Details:
  TestName: getSetDiscountRate
  Description: Tests if the getDiscountRate method returns the correct float value that has been previously set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a PurchaseOrder instance and set the discount rate to a specific float value (e.g., 0.15f).
  Act: Call getDiscountRate method on the PurchaseOrder instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value equals the value set (0.15f).
Validation:
  This test ensures that getDiscountRate accurately fetches the discount rate that was previously set, highlighting the method's reliability in returning exact values post-initialization. It helps confirm data integrity and correctness of value retrieval from the object's state.

Scenario 3: Consistency of return value upon multiple retrievals

Details:
  TestName: checkRetrievalConsistencyAfterMultipleCalls
  Description: Checks if multiple calls to getDiscountRate return the same value each time when no modifications are made between calls.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a PurchaseOrder instance and set the discount rate to a specific value (e.g., 0.10f).
  Act: Call getDiscountRate method on the PurchaseOrder instance multiple times.
  Assert: Assert that all returned values from these multiple calls are the same.
Validation:
  This test checks the consistency and reliability of the getDiscountRate method to ensure it returns a stable value across multiple calls under unchanged circumstances. This is crucial for ensuring that the getter method does not inadvertently modify data or behave unpredictably across successive operations.

Scenario 4: Verify thread safety of getDiscountRate method

Details:
  TestName: ensureThreadSafetyOfGetDiscountRate
  Description: Verifies that the getDiscountRate method is thread-safe and returns consistent results when accessed by multiple threads simultaneously.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a PurchaseOrder instance and set the discount rate. Spawn multiple threads to retrieve the discount rate simultaneously.
  Act: Each thread calls getDiscountRate method on the same PurchaseOrder instance.
  Assert: Assert that all threads receive the correct and consistent discount rate value.
Validation:
  This test evaluates the thread safety of the getDiscountRate method, ensuring that concurrent access by multiple threads does not lead to inconsistent results or race conditions. This is especially relevant in multi-threaded application environments where the same PurchaseOrder instance might be read by different parts of the system simultaneously.
