Scenario 1: Valid VAT Rate Retrieval

Details:
  TestName: retrieveValidVatRate
  Description: This test checks the correct retrieval of a VAT rate that has been previously set in a PurchaseOrder instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a PurchaseOrder instance and set a specific VAT rate using setVatRate method.
  Act: Retrieve the VAT rate using the getVatRate method.
  Assert: Assert that the retrieved VAT rate matches the expected VAT rate set earlier.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. The assertion confirms that the getVatRate method accurately retrieves the VAT rate that was set, ensuring that data integrity is maintained within the PurchaseOrder entity.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic. This test ensures that the financial calculations related to VAT can rely on the accuracy of the VAT rate stored in the PurchaseOrder.

Scenario 2: Default VAT Rate on New PurchaseOrder

Details:
  TestName: defaultVatRateOnNewPurchaseOrder
  Description: This test verifies that the initial state of VAT rate is null when a new PurchaseOrder instance is created, assuming no default value is set in the constructor or initializer block.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new PurchaseOrder instance without setting the VAT rate.
  Act: Retrieve the VAT rate using the getVatRate method.
  Assert: Assert that the retrieved VAT rate is null.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. The assertion checks that the VAT rate is null by default, which is expected behavior unless explicitly set otherwise.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test. This test is crucial to ensure that the system correctly handles cases where the VAT rate has not been set, preventing unintended behavior during financial calculations.

Scenario 3: VAT Rate Precision Integrity

Details:
  TestName: checkVatRatePrecision
  Description: This test ensures that the VAT rate maintains its precision after being set and retrieved, which is important for accurate financial reporting and calculations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a PurchaseOrder instance and set a VAT rate with high precision (e.g., 19.12345).
  Act: Retrieve the VAT rate using the getVatRate method.
  Assert: Assert that the retrieved VAT rate matches the set rate with the exact precision.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. This test verifies that the VAT rate does not lose its precision during the process of setting and getting from a PurchaseOrder, which is crucial for maintaining accurate financial records.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test. Ensuring the precision of financial figures like the VAT rate is fundamental for compliance with financial regulations and accurate tax calculations.

Scenario 4: Negative VAT Rate Handling

Details:
  TestName: handleNegativeVatRate
  Description: This test checks how the PurchaseOrder entity handles a scenario where a negative VAT rate is set, which might represent an incorrect input scenario.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a PurchaseOrder instance and set a negative VAT rate (e.g., -5.0).
  Act: Retrieve the VAT rate using the getVatRate method.
  Assert: Assert that the retrieved VAT rate is the negative value that was set.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. The assertion confirms that the getVatRate method accurately retrieves whatever VAT rate is set, even if it is negative.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test. This test is important to check the robustness of the PurchaseOrder entity in handling potentially erroneous input and to understand the behavior of the system under such conditions.
