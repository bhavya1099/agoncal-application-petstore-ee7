Scenario 1: Verify getVersion returns the correct version number

Details:
  TestName: verifyGetVersionReturnsCorrectValue
  Description: This test checks if the getVersion method returns the correct version number of the Product instance as set by the setVersion method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product instance and set its version using the setVersion method.
  Act: Retrieve the version number using the getVersion method.
  Assert: Assert that the retrieved version number matches the expected value that was set.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. This test ensures that the Product class correctly handles and retrieves the version state, which is crucial for version control and potentially for concurrency handling in a database context.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic. Ensuring that the version number is accurately managed allows systems to handle data consistency and integrity, especially in environments where data might be accessed or modified concurrently.

Scenario 2: Verify getVersion returns the default version number when not explicitly set

Details:
  TestName: verifyGetVersionReturnsDefaultWhenNotSet
  Description: This test checks if the getVersion method returns a default value (typically 0 in Java for uninitialized int fields) when the version is not explicitly set on a new Product instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Product instance without setting the version.
  Act: Retrieve the version number using the getVersion method.
  Assert: Assert that the retrieved version number is 0, assuming default initialization behavior for integers in Java.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. This test verifies that the default state of the version field is correctly initialized and handled, which is important for understanding the initial state of new entities.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic. Testing the initial state of objects is crucial to ensure that the system behaves predictably before any modifications are made, particularly relevant in scenarios involving persistence or serialization where defaults matter.

Scenario 3: Verify getVersion consistency after multiple updates

Details:
  TestName: verifyGetVersionConsistencyAfterMultipleUpdates
  Description: This test checks if the getVersion method consistently returns the latest version number after multiple updates to the version field.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product instance and update its version multiple times using the setVersion method.
  Act: Retrieve the version number using the getVersion method after the updates.
  Assert: Assert that the retrieved version number matches the last value set.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. This test ensures that the version field is not only settable but also retains its value across multiple changes, which is critical for maintaining the integrity of version tracking.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic. Ensuring that updates to the version field are accurately reflected in subsequent retrievals is vital for scenarios where version tracking dictates workflow or processing logic, such as in document control systems or multi-user environments.
