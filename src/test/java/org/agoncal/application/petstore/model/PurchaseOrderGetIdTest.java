Scenario 1: Basic retrieval of purchase order ID

  Details:
    TestName: getIdOfExistingPurchaseOrder
    Description: Test to ensure that the getId method correctly returns the ID set in the PurchaseOrder object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of PurchaseOrder and set its id to a specific value.
    Act: Retrieve the ID using the getId method.
    Assert: Check that the returned ID matches the expected ID set during the arrange step.
  Validation:
    Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: that the getId method accurately retrieves the ID that was set.
    Significance: Ensures that the ID property is stored and retrieved accurately, which is crucial for identifying objects in persistence operations or business logic comparisons.

Scenario 2: Retrieve ID when no ID has been set

  Details:
    TestName: getIdWhenIdIsNull
    Description: Test to check that the getId method returns null when the ID has not been initialized or set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of PurchaseOrder without setting its id.
    Act: Retrieve the ID using the getId method.
    Assert: Check that the returned ID is null.
  Validation:
    Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: that the getId method handles cases where the id is null by returning a null value.
    Significance: Critical for understanding object state when not all properties have been initialized or when working with newly created and unsaved entity instances.

Scenario 3: Consistent retrieval of the same ID in multiple calls

  Details:
    TestName: consistentIdWithMultipleGetCalls
    Description: Test to ensure that multiple calls to getId method return the same ID consistently if the ID has not been changed between calls.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a PurchaseOrder instance and set a fixed ID.
    Act: Retrieve the ID using the getId method multiple times.
    Assert: All retrieved IDs are identical to each other and match the originally set ID.
  Validation:
    Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: consistency of the returned value on repeated method calls.
    Significance: Validates that the PurchaseOrder's id property is not inadvertently modified between calls to getId, confirming immutability of the field with respect to getter calls.

These scenarios test fundamental assumptions and behaviors about managing entity identities through the getId method in a persistence context. Their correct behavior is essential to ensure proper entity tracking and management in any system where PurchaseOrder objects are used.
