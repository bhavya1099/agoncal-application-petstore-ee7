```
Scenario 1: Two PurchaseOrders with identical orderDate and customer

Details:
  TestName: checkHashCodeForIdenticalPurchaseOrders
  Description: This test verifies that the hashCode method returns the same hash code for two PurchaseOrder objects having the same orderDate and customer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two PurchaseOrder instances with identical orderDate and customer values.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on both instances.
  Assert: Assert that the hash codes returned by the two PurchaseOrder instances are the same.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: The assertion checks that the hashCode implementation correctly uses the orderDate and customer to compute the hash. If two objects are equal according to the equals method, their hash codes must also be the same, as per the contract of hashCode in Java. This test ensures consistency between equals and hashCode methods.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Ensures that PurchaseOrder objects can be correctly used in hash-based collections like HashSet or HashMap, maintaining integrity when objects are considered equal.

Scenario 2: Two PurchaseOrders with different orderDate

Details:
  TestName: checkHashCodeForDifferentOrderDates
  Description: This test checks that the hashCode method returns different hash codes for two PurchaseOrder objects that differ only by their orderDate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two PurchaseOrder instances with different orderDate but the same customer.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on both instances.
  Assert: Assert that the hash codes returned by the two PurchaseOrder instances are different.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: The assertion verifies that differentiating properties (orderDate in this case) are effectively contributing to the hash code calculation. This is crucial for the correct functioning of hash-based collections where objects should not collide excessively.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Prevents potential performance issues in collections by ensuring proper distribution of hash codes.

Scenario 3: Two PurchaseOrders with different customers

Details:
  TestName: checkHashCodeForDifferentCustomers
  Description: This test ensures that the hashCode method produces different hash codes for two PurchaseOrder objects that differ only by their customer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two PurchaseOrder instances with the same orderDate but different customers.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on both instances.
  Assert: Assert that the hash codes returned by the two instances are different.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: The test checks that the customer property significantly impacts the hash code result, which is essential for correct hash code generation.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Ensures that PurchaseOrder objects with different customers are treated as distinct in scenarios where hash-based data structures are used, thus maintaining data integrity.

Scenario 4: Null values in properties

Details:
  TestName: checkHashCodeWithNullValues
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the hashCode method when the properties used in hash code computation (orderDate or customer) are null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a PurchaseOrder instance with null values for orderDate and customer.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on this instance.
  Assert: Assert that a valid hash code is returned and no exception is thrown.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: Ensures that the hashCode method is robust and can handle null values gracefully, which is crucial for avoiding runtime exceptions in production.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Enhances the reliability of the application by ensuring that objects with incomplete data do not cause failures when used in hash-based collections.
