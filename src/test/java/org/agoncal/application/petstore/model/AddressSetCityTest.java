Here are the test scenarios for the `setCity` method:
**Scenario 1: Set City with Valid String**
Details:
TestName: setValidCity
Description: Test setting a valid city string to ensure it is correctly stored in the `city` field.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the class with all fields initialized to null.
Act: Call `setCity` with a valid city string, e.g., "New York".
Assert: Verify that the `city` field is set to the expected value using `assertEquals`.
Validation:
This test aims to verify that the `setCity` method correctly sets the `city` field when a valid string is provided. This is essential to ensure that the city information is accurately stored in the object.
**Scenario 2: Set City with Null Value**
Details:
TestName: setNullCity
Description: Test setting a null value for the city to ensure it is handled correctly.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the class with all fields initialized to null.
Act: Call `setCity` with a null value.
Assert: Verify that the `city` field is set to null using `assertNull`.
Validation:
This test aims to verify that the `setCity` method correctly handles null values for the city. This is important to ensure that the object remains in a valid state even when no city information is provided.
**Scenario 3: Set City with Empty String**
Details:
TestName: setEmptyCity
Description: Test setting an empty string for the city to ensure it is handled correctly.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the class with all fields initialized to null.
Act: Call `setCity` with an empty string, e.g., "".
Assert: Verify that the `city` field is set to the expected value using `assertEquals`.
Validation:
This test aims to verify that the `setCity` method correctly handles empty strings for the city. This is important to ensure that the object remains in a valid state even when an empty string is provided.
**Scenario 4: Set City with Long String**
Details:
TestName: setLongCity
Description: Test setting a long string for the city to ensure it is handled correctly.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the class with all fields initialized to null.
Act: Call `setCity` with a long string, e.g., "This is a very long city name that exceeds the maximum allowed length".
Assert: Verify that the `city` field is set to the expected value using `assertEquals`.
Validation:
This test aims to verify that the `setCity` method correctly handles long strings for the city. This is important to ensure that the object remains in a valid state even when a long string is provided.
**Scenario 5: Set City with Multiple Calls**
Details:
TestName: setCityMultipleTimes
Description: Test setting the city multiple times to ensure that the latest value is stored.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the class with all fields initialized to null.
Act: Call `setCity` with a valid city string, e.g., "New York".
Act: Call `setCity` again with a different valid city string, e.g., "Chicago".
Assert: Verify that the `city` field is set to the latest value using `assertEquals`.
Validation:
This test aims to verify that the `setCity` method correctly updates the `city` field when called multiple times. This is essential to ensure that the latest city information is accurately stored in the object.
These test scenarios cover various edge cases and ensure that the `setCity` method behaves as expected in different situations.
