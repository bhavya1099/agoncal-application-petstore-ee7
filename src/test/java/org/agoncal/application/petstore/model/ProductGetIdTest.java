"""
  Scenario 1: Test to verify the getId method returns correct product Id

  Details:
    TestName: testGetIdReturnsCorrectProductId.
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getId method, specifically whether it returns the correct product id.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a new Product object and set a known id using setId method.
    Act: Invoke the getId method on the created product object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned id against the known id set earlier.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getId method correctly retrieves the id of the product.
    This test is significant as it ensures the correct product id can be retrieved, which is crucial for identifying a specific product within the system.

  Scenario 2: Test to verify the getId method handles null Id

  Details:
    TestName: testGetIdHandlesNullId.
    Description: This test is meant to check how the getId method handles the situation when the product id is null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a new Product object without setting an id.
    Act: Invoke the getId method on the created product object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned id against null.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getId method correctly handles null id and returns null.
    This is significant in ensuring the method doesn't throw an error when retrieving an id from a product that hasn't been assigned an id yet.

  Scenario 3: Test to verify the getId method's consistency

  Details:
    TestName: testGetIdConsistency.
    Description: This test is meant to check the consistency of the getId method, specifically whether it returns the same id on multiple invocations.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a new Product object and set a known id using setId method.
    Act: Invoke the getId method on the created product object multiple times.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned ids from each invocation to ensure they are all the same.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getId method consistently returns the same id with multiple invocations.
    This is significant in ensuring the method is reliable and consistent, crucial for the accurate retrieval of product ids.
