Based on the provided information and the method `getId()`, here are some test scenarios:
Scenario 1: Retrieve Valid ID
Details:
  TestName: getValidId
  Description: This test verifies that the getId() method correctly returns a valid, non-null Long value when an ID has been set for the Customer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Customer instance and set a known ID value using the setId() method.
  Act: Call the getId() method on the Customer instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned ID matches the value that was set.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getId() method correctly retrieves the ID value that was previously set. It's crucial for maintaining data integrity and for operations that rely on unique identification of Customer entities.
Scenario 2: Retrieve Null ID
Details:
  TestName: getNullId
  Description: This test checks the behavior of getId() when no ID has been set for the Customer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Customer instance without setting an ID.
  Act: Call the getId() method on the Customer instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  This test confirms that getId() returns null when no ID has been set. This is important for distinguishing between new, unsaved Customer entities and those that have been persisted with an assigned ID.
Scenario 3: ID Immutability
Details:
  TestName: idImmutability
  Description: This test ensures that the getId() method always returns the most recently set ID value, even after multiple changes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Customer instance, set an initial ID, then change it to a different value.
  Act: Call the getId() method on the Customer instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned ID matches the most recently set value.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the getId() method always reflects the current state of the Customer's ID. It's crucial for scenarios where the ID might be changed (e.g., during data migration or entity merging) to ensure that the getter always provides the most up-to-date value.
Scenario 4: ID Type Consistency
Details:
  TestName: idTypeConsistency
  Description: This test verifies that the getId() method always returns a Long type, even when the ID is set using a compatible numeric type.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Customer instance and set the ID using an int value that can be safely converted to Long.
  Act: Call the getId() method on the Customer instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is of type Long and matches the set value.
Validation:
  This test ensures type consistency of the ID field, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity and preventing type-related errors in operations that depend on the Customer's ID.
Note: These scenarios focus on the core functionality of the getId() method, considering the limited context provided. They cover the basic cases of retrieving set and unset IDs, as well as checking for consistency in ID values and types. Additional scenarios might be developed based on specific business rules or constraints that aren't apparent from the given information.
