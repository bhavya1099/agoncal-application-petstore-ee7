```
Scenario 1: Retrieve Valid Login

Details:
  TestName: shouldRetrieveValidLogin
  Description: This test checks whether the getLogin method correctly retrieves a non-null, non-empty login string that has been previously set.
Execution:
  Arrange: A Customer object is instantiated and the setLogin method is called with a valid string "johnDoe123".
  Act: The getLogin method is called.
  Assert: Assert that the returned login string matches "johnDoe123".
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getLogin method correctly returns the exact login string that was set. This is crucial to ensure that user login information is accurately maintained and retrieved, which is fundamental for user authentication processes.

Scenario 2: Retrieve Login When Unset

Details:
  TestName: shouldHandleNullLogin
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the getLogin method when the login has not been set, expecting it to return null.
Execution:
  Arrange: A Customer object is instantiated without setting the login.
  Act: The getLogin method is called.
  Assert: Assert that the returned login string is null.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that getLogin handles cases where the login is not set by returning null. This is important for identifying uninitialized or new Customer objects in the system.

Scenario 3: Consistency of Retrieved Login After Multiple Calls

Details:
  TestName: shouldReturnSameLoginOnMultipleCalls
  Description: This test ensures that multiple calls to getLogin return the same result, demonstrating the method's consistency.
Execution:
  Arrange: A Customer object is instantiated and setLogin is called with "consistentUser".
  Act: The getLogin method is called twice consecutively.
  Assert: Assert that both returned login strings are the same and equal to "consistentUser".
Validation:
  The assertion checks the consistency of the getLogin method across multiple invocations. Consistency here is vital to ensure that the login retrieval mechanism is reliable and stable, which is essential for any operations that depend on user identification.

Scenario 4: Effect of Setting Login to Empty String

Details:
  TestName: shouldHandleEmptyLoginString
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the getLogin method when the login is explicitly set to an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: A Customer object is instantiated and setLogin is called with an empty string "".
  Act: The getLogin method is called.
  Assert: Assert that the returned login string is an empty string.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the getLogin method can handle and return an empty string, which might represent a specific edge case in the application's user management logic. Ensuring that such edge cases are handled appropriately helps maintain robustness in the application's functionality.

Scenario 5: Independence of Login Retrieval From Other Attributes

Details:
  TestName: shouldNotBeAffectedByOtherAttributes
  Description: This test checks that the retrieval of the login value is independent of other customer attributes being set or changed.
Execution:
  Arrange: A Customer object is instantiated, setLogin is called with "independentLogin", and other unrelated attributes such as setEmail and setFirstName are set.
  Act: The getLogin method is called.
  Assert: Assert that the returned login string remains "independentLogin".
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the login retrieval is isolated and not inadvertently affected by modifications to other attributes of the Customer. This isolation is key to ensuring that distinct aspects of the Customer entity do not interfere with each other, maintaining data integrity and consistency.
