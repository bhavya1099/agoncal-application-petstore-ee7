Scenario 1: Retrieve Valid Telephone Number

Details:
  TestName: shouldReturnValidTelephone
  Description: This test checks whether the getTelephone method returns a valid telephone number when the telephone field is set with a proper value.
Execution:
  Arrange: A Customer object is created and the setTelephone method is invoked with a valid telephone number.
  Act: The getTelephone method is called on the Customer object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned telephone number matches the one set during arrangement.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test confirms that the getTelephone method correctly retrieves the telephone number that was previously set.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensures that the telephone retrieval functionality works as expected, which is critical for contact-related operations in the application.

Scenario 2: Retrieve Telephone Number When None Set

Details:
  TestName: shouldReturnNullWhenTelephoneNotSet
  Description: This test verifies that the getTelephone method returns null when no telephone number has been set on the Customer object.
Execution:
  Arrange: A new Customer object is created without setting the telephone field.
  Act: The getTelephone method is called on this newly created Customer object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned telephone number is null.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test checks that the getTelephone method handles cases where the telephone field is not set by returning null.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensures that the method behaves correctly in scenarios where telephone data might not be available, preventing potential errors in the application.

Scenario 3: Retrieve Telephone Number After Resetting

Details:
  TestName: shouldHandleResettingOfTelephone
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the getTelephone method after the telephone number is initially set and then reset to a new value.
Execution:
  Arrange: A Customer object is created and set with an initial telephone number, then it is reset to a different valid telephone number.
  Act: The getTelephone method is called after the reset.
  Assert: Assert that the returned telephone number matches the new value set after the reset.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test ensures that getTelephone accurately reflects updates to the telephone field.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Important for scenarios where customer information is updated, ensuring the system reflects the most current data.

Scenario 4: Consistency of Telephone Retrieval

Details:
  TestName: shouldReturnConsistentTelephoneOnMultipleCalls
  Description: This test ensures that multiple calls to getTelephone return the same value, assuming no changes are made to the telephone field in between calls.
Execution:
  Arrange: A Customer object is created and set with a valid telephone number.
  Act: The getTelephone method is called multiple times without altering the telephone field.
  Assert: Assert that all calls return the same telephone number.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test checks for consistency in the returned value of getTelephone across multiple invocations.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Verifies that the method is free from side-effects or unintended state changes, which is crucial for reliability and debugging.
