Here are the JUnit test scenarios for the `getDateOfBirth` method of the `Customer` entity:

```
Scenario 1: Basic retrieval of the Date of Birth

Details:
  TestName: testGetDateOfBirthBasic
  Description: This test checks the basic functionality of the getDateOfBirth method to ensure it returns the correct Date object as set in the Customer entity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a Customer object and set a known Date of Birth using setDateOfBirth.
  Act: Retrieve the Date of Birth using getDateOfBirth.
  Assert: Assert that the retrieved Date of Birth matches the Date that was set initially.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that getDateOfBirth correctly retrieves the date that was initially set, confirming the method's ability to fetch the exact date of birth value stored in the entity. This test is significant as it confirms the method's basic functionality and data retrieval integrity.

Scenario 2: Retrieval of Date of Birth when not set

Details:
  TestName: testGetDateOfBirthWhenNotSet
  Description: This test ensures that the getDateOfBirth method returns null when the date of birth has not been set in the Customer entity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Customer object without setting the date of birth.
  Act: Attempt to retrieve the Date of Birth using getDateOfBirth.
  Assert: Assert that the result is null.
Validation:
  This assertion checks that the method correctly handles cases where no date of birth is set, returning null. It is important for handling scenarios where customer data might be incomplete, ensuring the application can gracefully handle missing information without error.

Scenario 3: Effect of setting Date of Birth on Customer's age calculation

Details:
  TestName: testAgeCalculationIntegrationWithDateOfBirth
  Description: This test checks that the age is calculated correctly when a Date of Birth is set and assesses the integration between setDateOfBirth and the lifecycle method calculateAge.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Customer object and set a Date of Birth to a specific past date.
  Act: Trigger the lifecycle methods that include calculateAge (e.g., by simulating entity loading or updating).
  Assert: Assert that the age is calculated correctly based on the date of birth set.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that setting the Date of Birth leads to a correct age calculation, demonstrating the effective integration between setting dates and lifecycle methods. This scenario is significant for ensuring that the application accurately calculates and updates age as needed, which could be crucial for business rules or logic that depend on the customer's age.
```

These scenarios cover basic functionality, error handling (or edge cases with null values), and integration with other parts of the entity's lifecycle management.
