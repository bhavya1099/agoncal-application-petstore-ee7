"""
Scenario 1: Test for equality with the same instance of OrderLine

Details:
  TestName: testEqualityWithSameInstance
  Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method correctly identifies that two references pointing to the same instance of OrderLine are indeed equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of OrderLine and assign it to two different references.
  Act: Use the equals method to check if these two references are equal.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is true.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies that two references pointing to the same instance are equal. This is important for ensuring the correctness of the equals method.

Scenario 2: Test for equality with a null object

Details:
  TestName: testEqualityWithNullObject
  Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method correctly identifies that an instance of OrderLine and null are not equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of OrderLine and a null reference.
  Act: Use the equals method to check if these two references are equal.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies that an instance of OrderLine and null are not equal. This is important for ensuring that the equals method can handle null values.

Scenario 3: Test for equality with different instances having the same quantity and item

Details:
  TestName: testEqualityWithSameQuantityAndItem
  Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method correctly identifies that two instances of OrderLine with the same quantity and item are equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of OrderLine with the same quantity and item values.
  Act: Use the equals method to check if these two instances are equal.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is true.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies that two instances of OrderLine with the same quantity and item are equal. This is important for ensuring the correctness of the equals method.

Scenario 4: Test for equality with different instances having different quantity

Details:
  TestName: testEqualityWithDifferentQuantity
  Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method correctly identifies that two instances of OrderLine with different quantity values are not equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of OrderLine with different quantity values.
  Act: Use the equals method to check if these two instances are equal.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies that two instances of OrderLine with different quantity values are not equal. This is important for ensuring the correctness of the equals method.

Scenario 5: Test for equality with different instances having different items

Details:
  TestName: testEqualityWithDifferentItems
  Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method correctly identifies that two instances of OrderLine with different item values are not equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of OrderLine with different item values.
  Act: Use the equals method to check if these two instances are equal.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies that two instances of OrderLine with different item values are not equal. This is important for ensuring the correctness of the equals method.
