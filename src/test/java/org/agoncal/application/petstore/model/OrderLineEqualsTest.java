```
Scenario 1: Test equality for two identical OrderLine objects

Details:
  TestName: checkEqualityForIdenticalOrderLines
  Description: This test checks if the equals method returns true when comparing two OrderLine objects with the same quantity and item.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two OrderLine objects with the same quantity and identical Item instances.
  Act: Compare these two OrderLine objects using the equals method.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is true.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test verifies that the equals method correctly identifies two objects as equal when all their relevant fields (quantity and item) match.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensuring that equals correctly identifies identical objects is critical for consistency in collections and other data structures that rely on equality checks.

Scenario 2: Test equality with null

Details:
  TestName: checkEqualityAgainstNull
  Description: This test checks if the equals method returns false when comparing an OrderLine object with null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an OrderLine object.
  Act: Compare this OrderLine object with null using the equals method.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test verifies that the equals method correctly identifies that an OrderLine object is not equal to null.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Proper handling of null is essential to prevent exceptions and ensure reliable operation of collections and equality checks.

Scenario 3: Test equality with a different class object

Details:
  TestName: checkEqualityWithDifferentClass
  Description: This test checks if the equals method returns false when an OrderLine object is compared with an object of a different class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an OrderLine object and an object of a different class (e.g., String).
  Act: Compare these two objects using the equals method.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test verifies that the equals method correctly identifies objects of different classes as unequal.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: This is crucial for maintaining type safety and correct behavior in heterogeneous environments.

Scenario 4: Test inequality for OrderLines with different quantities

Details:
  TestName: checkInequalityForDifferentQuantities
  Description: This test evaluates the equals method to determine if it returns false for two OrderLine objects that differ only by quantity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two OrderLine objects with different quantities but the same item.
  Act: Compare these two OrderLine objects using the equals method.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test ensures that the equals method considers quantity in its equality check.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensuring that OrderLine objects with different quantities are considered unequal is important for accurate inventory and order management.

Scenario 5: Test inequality for OrderLines with different items

Details:
  TestName: checkInequalityForDifferentItems
  Description: This test checks if the equals method returns false when comparing two OrderLine objects that have the same quantity but different items.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two OrderLine objects with the same quantity but different items.
  Act: Compare these two OrderLine objects using the equals method.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test ensures that the equals method considers the item in its equality check.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Accurate identification of differences in items is crucial for order accuracy and inventory management.
