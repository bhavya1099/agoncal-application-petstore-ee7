Here are the JUnit test scenarios for the `getAge` method of the `Customer` class:

```
Scenario 1: Customer has a valid date of birth

Details:
  TestName: getAgeWithValidBirthDate
  Description: Test to verify that the getAge method returns the correct age for a customer with a valid date of birth.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Customer instance and set a valid date of birth.
  Act: Call the getAge method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned age matches the expected age based on the date of birth.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the age calculation correctly handles a valid date of birth and returns the accurate age.
  It is crucial for ensuring the calculateAge logic effectively computes age which intersects with core functionality like age-based access or restrictions in the business domain.

Scenario 2: Customer has no date of birth set

Details:
  TestName: getAgeWithNullBirthDate
  Description: Test to verify that the getAge method returns null when no date of birth is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Customer instance without setting the date of birth.
  Act: Call the getAge method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  This test ascertains that the method correctly handles cases when the date of birth is not available, thereby avoiding potential NullPointerException.
  It is significant as it addresses robustness of the application by gracefully handling missing data.

Scenario 3: Customer's date of birth is today

Details:
  TestName: getAgeWithBirthDateToday
  Description: Test to check getAge method behavior when the customer's date of birth is the current date.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the customer’s date of birth to today's date.
  Act: Invoke the getAge method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned age is 0.
Validation:
  The test confirms that the age calculation logic correctly treats the boundary condition of being born "today," interpreting it as an age of zero.
  This scenario is critical for ensuring that edge-case dates are handled correctly, preventing logical errors in age-based computations.

Scenario 4: Customer's date of birth is on a leap day

Details:
  TestName: getAgeWithLeapDayBirthDate
  Description: Test the getAge method for a customer born on February 29th to ensure accurate age calculation on leap years.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the customer’s date of birth to February 29th of a leap year.
  Act: Call the getAge method.
  Assert: Verify that the age is calculated correctly during a leap year and non-leap year.
Validation:
  This asserts the method's accuracy under the special circumstance of leap year birthdays, which might otherwise lead to errors every four years.
  This test ensures application correctness over time-sensitive data critical for features that depend on precise age calculation.

Scenario 5: Age calculation on the day before the birthday

Details:
  TestName: getAgeDayBeforeBirthday
  Description: Ensures that the age is calculated correctly when the current date is one day before the customer's next birthday.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the customer's birth date to the day after the current date from a past year.
  Act: Invoke the getAge method.
  Assert: Assert that the age returned is what it would be the day before their birthday.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the age reflects not having reached the birthday for the current year.
  Validating this condition is vital for precise age calculations, which might be essential for age-specific entitlements or restrictions.
```

These scenarios comprehensively test `getAge` across typical, edge, and error cases, ensuring the method's robustness and accuracy in the customer management system.

/*
The failure in the test `getAgeDayBeforeBirthday` can be attributed to incorrect calculation or setting of the `age` attribute within the `Customer` class. This method involves computing the age based on the date of birth and comparing it with the expected age, but fails because the calculated age does not match the expected result.

Here's a breakdown of the issue:

1. **Test Setup Error**: The test sets up a birth date for a customer: February 28, 2000. The current hardcoded test date is set to February 27, 2021. The `calculateAge` method is supposed to calculate age as the difference in years, accounting for whether the birthday has occurred yet in the current year. Here, since the birthday in 2021 has not happened yet by February 27, the proper age should be 20, calculated as 2021 - 2000 - 1.

2. **Expected vs. Actual**: The test expects the age to be 20 based on the computation, but the actual result that comes up is 24. This mismatch indicates issues in the `calculateAge` method which seems to not correctly calculate the ages based on given birthdays just before the actual date. It implies an error possibly in the handling of year boundaries or incorrect date adjustment.

3. **Potential Causes**:
   - Implementation of `calculateAge` might not correctly handle dates just before the birthday properly by subtracting a year if the current month and day have not reached the month and day of birth.
   - Date wrapping or off-by-one errors in handling dates could affect the calculation.

4. **Missing Method**: The mention of `customer.calculateAge()` in the test demonstrates reliance on this method for computing the `age`, however, there is no prior indication or evidence of such a method being defined or its implementation being provided in the description of the `Customer` class. Therefore, if `calculateAge` is improperly implemented or not implemented at all, and doesn’t update the `age` appropriately, the age returned by `getAge()` will be incorrect leading to test failure.

This detailed examination showcases how the test is failing due to likely incorrect logic within the age calculation method in the `Customer` class which doesn't align with the intended outcomes in the specific edge case presented by the test.
@Test
@Category(Categories.boundary.class)
public void getAgeDayBeforeBirthday() {
    Customer customer = new Customer();
    Calendar birthDate = new GregorianCalendar(2000, Calendar.FEBRUARY, 28);
    customer.setDateOfBirth(birthDate.getTime());
    customer.calculateAge();
    Calendar today = new GregorianCalendar();
    today.set(Calendar.YEAR, 2021);
    today.set(Calendar.MONTH, Calendar.FEBRUARY);
    today.set(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 27);
    customer.setDateOfBirth(birthDate.getTime());
    customer.calculateAge();
    int expectedAgeToday = today.get(Calendar.YEAR) - birthDate.get(Calendar.YEAR) - 1;
    assertEquals((Integer) expectedAgeToday, customer.getAge());
