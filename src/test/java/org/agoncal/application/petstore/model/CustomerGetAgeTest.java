```
Scenario 1: Customer with known date of birth

Details:
  TestName: calculateAgeForKnownBirthDate
  Description: Test the age calculation for a customer with a known date of birth to ensure the method correctly computes age based on the current date.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Customer instance and set a known date of birth.
  Act: Call the calculateAge method and then retrieve the age using getAge.
  Assert: Assert that the returned age matches the expected age based on the date of birth.
Validation:
  Validate that the age is correctly calculated by comparing it to the expected value. This test confirms the correctness of the age calculation logic, which is critical for any functionalities or business rules depending on the customer's age.

Scenario 2: Customer with no date of birth

Details:
  TestName: calculateAgeWithNullBirthDate
  Description: Verify that the age remains null if the date of birth is not set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Customer instance without setting the date of birth.
  Act: Call the calculateAge method and then retrieve the age using getAge.
  Assert: Assert that the age is null.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the system gracefully handles cases where the date of birth is not available, avoiding any potential errors or exceptions in age-based calculations.

Scenario 3: Customer born on a leap day

Details:
  TestName: calculateAgeForLeapDayBirthDate
  Description: Ensure that the age calculation correctly handles customers born on February 29th, considering leap years.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the date of birth to February 29th of a leap year for a Customer instance.
  Act: Call the calculateAge method and then retrieve the age using getAge during a non-leap year.
  Assert: Assert that the age is correctly calculated considering leap year adjustments.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the robustness of the age calculation logic in handling special cases such as leap years, which is important for maintaining accurate age data.

Scenario 4: Customer born today

Details:
  TestName: calculateAgeForCustomerBornToday
  Description: Test the age calculation when the customer's date of birth is the current date.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the date of birth to today's date for a Customer instance.
  Act: Call the calculateAge method and then retrieve the age using getAge.
  Assert: Assert that the age is 0.
Validation:
  Validates that the age calculation correctly identifies and handles the edge case where the customer is born on the day of the calculation, ensuring that the age is set to 0.

Scenario 5: Customer born in the future

Details:
  TestName: calculateAgeForFutureBirthDate
  Description: Ensure that the age calculation does not permit a future date of birth, potentially setting the age to a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a future date of birth for a Customer instance.
  Act: Call the calculateAge method and then retrieve the age using getAge.
  Assert: Assert that the age is null or handled appropriately (throw an exception or set to a default value).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the system handles logically impossible scenarios such as future birth dates, either by setting the age to null or by handling the case appropriately, thereby maintaining data integrity and preventing incorrect age calculations.
