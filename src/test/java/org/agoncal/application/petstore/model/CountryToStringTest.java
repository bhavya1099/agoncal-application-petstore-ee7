Based on the provided information and the toString() method of the Country entity, here are some test scenarios:
Scenario 1: Test toString() with a valid country name
Details:
  TestName: toStringWithValidName
  Description: Verify that the toString() method correctly returns the name of the country when a valid name is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Country object and set a valid name using the setName() method.
  Act: Call the toString() method on the Country object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned string matches the set name.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the toString() method correctly represents the Country object by returning its name. It's important for debugging and logging purposes, as well as for any code that might rely on the string representation of a Country object.
Scenario 2: Test toString() with null name
Details:
  TestName: toStringWithNullName
  Description: Check the behavior of toString() when the country name is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Country object without setting a name (leaving it null).
  Act: Call the toString() method on the Country object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned string is null or an empty string (depending on how null is handled in the toString() implementation).
Validation:
  This test verifies how the toString() method handles a null name, which is important for robustness and preventing NullPointerExceptions in code that uses this method.
Scenario 3: Test toString() with empty name
Details:
  TestName: toStringWithEmptyName
  Description: Verify the behavior of toString() when the country name is an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Country object and set its name to an empty string using the setName() method.
  Act: Call the toString() method on the Country object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned string is an empty string.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the toString() method correctly handles empty strings, which is important for consistency and avoiding potential issues with code that relies on non-empty string representations.
Scenario 4: Test toString() after changing the name
Details:
  TestName: toStringAfterNameChange
  Description: Verify that the toString() method reflects changes to the country name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Country object, set an initial name, then change the name using setName().
  Act: Call the toString() method on the Country object after changing the name.
  Assert: Verify that the returned string matches the new name, not the original one.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the toString() method always returns the current name of the country, even after it has been changed. This is crucial for maintaining consistency between the object's state and its string representation.
Scenario 5: Test toString() with a very long name
Details:
  TestName: toStringWithLongName
  Description: Check the behavior of toString() when the country name is exceptionally long.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Country object and set its name to a very long string (e.g., 1000 characters) using the setName() method.
  Act: Call the toString() method on the Country object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned string matches the entire long name without truncation.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the toString() method can handle extremely long names without truncating or altering the output. It's important for ensuring that the method works correctly with edge cases and doesn't introduce unexpected behavior with unusually long inputs.
These scenarios cover various aspects of the toString() method, including normal operation, edge cases, and potential error conditions, using only the methods and information provided in the original description.
