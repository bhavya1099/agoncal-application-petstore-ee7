```
Scenario 1: Valid Expiration Date Retrieval

Details:
  TestName: retrieveValidCreditCardExpDate
  Description: Test to ensure that the credit card expiration date is correctly retrieved from a CreditCard instance that has a valid expiration date set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CreditCard instance and use setCreditCardExpDate to set a valid expiration date.
  Act: Call getCreditCardExpDate to retrieve the expiration date.
  Assert: Assert that the returned expiration date matches the one that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getCreditCardExpDate method correctly reads the expiration date that was previously set using setCreditCardExpDate. This test is significant as it confirms the basic retrieval functionality of expiration date properties within the CreditCard entity.

Scenario 2: Null Expiration Date

Details:
  TestName: retrieveNullCreditCardExpDate
  Description: Test to ensure that getCreditCardExpDate handles null values gracefully when no expiration date has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CreditCard instance without setting the expiration date.
  Act: Call getCreditCardExpDate to attempt retrieving the expiration date.
  Assert: Assert that the returned expiration date is null.
Validation:
  This assertion checks that the method returns null when no data has been set, which is expected behavior for a getter when its corresponding value has not been initialized. Testing for null handling is crucial to avoid unexpected errors or exceptions in the application flow.

Scenario 3: Empty Expiration Date String

Details:
  TestName: retrieveEmptyCreditCardExpDate
  Description: Test whether the getCreditCardExpDate method can handle cases where the expiration date is set to an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CreditCard instance and set the expiration date to an empty string using setCreditCardExpDate.
  Act: Call getCreditCardExpDate to retrieve the expiration date.
  Assert: Assert that the returned expiration date is an empty string.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the getter method does not modify the data and returns exactly what is stored, even if it's an empty string. It helps in verifying the integrity of data retrieval mechanisms in the entity's design.

Scenario 4: Expiration Date with Whitespace Characters

Details:
  TestName: retrieveWhitespaceCreditCardExpDate
  Description: Test the retrieval of a credit card expiration date that includes only whitespace characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CreditCard instance and set the expiration date to a string of whitespace characters.
  Act: Call getCreditCardExpDate to retrieve the expiration date.
  Assert: Assert that the returned expiration date matches the whitespace string set earlier.
Validation:
  The effective verification of this scenario ensures that the getCreditCardExpDate method accurately returns even non-standard strings like those containing only whitespace, which is crucial for ensuring comprehensive data handling capabilities of the application.

Scenario 5: Change and Retrieve Expiration Date

Details:
  TestName: changeAndRetrieveCreditCardExpDate
  Description: Test the behavior of setting a new expiration date on a CreditCard instance and then retrieving it to verify the update.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CreditCard instance and set an initial expiration date. Then change this date to a different valid string.
  Act: Call getCreditCardExpDate to retrieve the updated expiration date.
  Assert: Assert that the expiration date retrieved matches the new date that was set.
Validation:
  This scenario confirms that the setter and getter for the expiration date are functioning as expected in dynamic conditions, where data changes over the lifespan of an object. It is vital for testing the robustness of state management within the CreditCard class.
