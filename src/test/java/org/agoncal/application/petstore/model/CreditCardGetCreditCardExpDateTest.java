Based on the provided information and the method getCreditCardExpDate(), here are several test scenarios:
Scenario 1: Retrieve Valid Credit Card Expiration Date
Details:
  TestName: getCreditCardExpDateReturnsValidDate()
  Description: Verify that the getCreditCardExpDate() method returns a valid expiration date when it has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CreditCard instance and set a valid expiration date using setCreditCardExpDate().
  Act: Call getCreditCardExpDate() on the CreditCard instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the expiration date that was set.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getCreditCardExpDate() method correctly retrieves the stored expiration date. It's crucial for maintaining the integrity of credit card information in the system.
Scenario 2: Retrieve Null Credit Card Expiration Date
Details:
  TestName: getCreditCardExpDateReturnsNull()
  Description: Verify that the getCreditCardExpDate() method returns null when no expiration date has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new CreditCard instance without setting an expiration date.
  Act: Call getCreditCardExpDate() on the CreditCard instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  This test checks the behavior of getCreditCardExpDate() when no expiration date has been set. It's important to handle cases where credit card information might be incomplete.
Scenario 3: Retrieve Credit Card Expiration Date After Modification
Details:
  TestName: getCreditCardExpDateReturnsUpdatedDate()
  Description: Verify that getCreditCardExpDate() returns the most recent value after the expiration date has been modified.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CreditCard instance, set an initial expiration date, then update it with a new value.
  Act: Call getCreditCardExpDate() on the CreditCard instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the updated expiration date.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getCreditCardExpDate() method reflects changes made to the expiration date. It's crucial for maintaining accurate and up-to-date credit card information.
Scenario 4: Verify Credit Card Expiration Date Consistency
Details:
  TestName: getCreditCardExpDateConsistentWithToString()
  Description: Ensure that the expiration date returned by getCreditCardExpDate() is consistent with the value in the toString() representation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CreditCard instance and set an expiration date.
  Act: Call getCreditCardExpDate() and toString() on the CreditCard instance.
  Assert: Verify that the expiration date from getCreditCardExpDate() is present in the string returned by toString().
Validation:
  This test checks for consistency between different methods that provide credit card information. It helps ensure that the credit card data is represented consistently across the entity.
Scenario 5: Verify Credit Card Expiration Date in Equals Comparison
Details:
  TestName: getCreditCardExpDateConsistentWithEquals()
  Description: Ensure that two CreditCard instances with the same expiration date are considered equal by the equals() method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two CreditCard instances with the same credit card number, type, and expiration date.
  Act: Call equals() to compare the two instances.
  Assert: Verify that equals() returns true, indicating that the expiration dates are considered in the equality check.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the expiration date is properly considered in object equality comparisons. It's important for maintaining data integrity when comparing or storing CreditCard objects.
These scenarios cover various aspects of the getCreditCardExpDate() method, including normal operation, edge cases, and its interaction with other methods in the CreditCard entity.
