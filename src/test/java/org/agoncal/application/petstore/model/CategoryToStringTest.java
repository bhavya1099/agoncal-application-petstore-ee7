Scenario 1: Test to verify the correct name is returned by the toString method

Details:
  TestName: verifyCorrectNameReturnedByToString
  Description: This test is designed to check the functionality of the toString method. The target scenario is when the method is called on a Category object with a name set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Category object and set its name to a known value.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the Category object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result from the toString method to the known name.
Validation:
  The assertion is verifying that the toString method correctly returns the name of the Category object. The expected result is the known name because the toString method is overridden to return the name of the Category. This is significant as it ensures that the toString method is functioning as expected, which is critical for debugging and logging.

Scenario 2: Test to verify the correct behavior of the toString method when the name is null

Details:
  TestName: verifyToStringWithNullName
  Description: This test is designed to check the functionality of the toString method when the name of the Category is null. The target scenario is when the method is called on a Category object with a null name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Category object without setting its name.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the Category object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result from the toString method to null.
Validation:
  The assertion is verifying that the toString method correctly handles a null name. The expected result is null because the toString method is overridden to return the name of the Category, and in this case, the name is null. This is significant as it validates that the toString method can handle null values, which is important for ensuring robustness of the application.

Scenario 3: Test to verify the correct behavior of the toString method with an empty name

Details:
  TestName: verifyToStringWithEmptyName
  Description: This test is designed to check the functionality of the toString method when the name of the Category is an empty string. The target scenario is when the method is called on a Category object with an empty name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Category object and set its name to an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the Category object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result from the toString method to an empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion is verifying that the toString method correctly handles an empty name. The expected result is an empty string because the toString method is overridden to return the name of the Category, and in this case, the name is an empty string. This is significant as it validates that the toString method can handle empty values, which is crucial for ensuring the robustness of the application.
