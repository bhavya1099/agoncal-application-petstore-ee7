### Scenario 1: Default version value test
Details:
  TestName: checkDefaultVersionValue
  Description: This test checks the default value of the version when a new OrderLine instance is created and not explicitly set. It ensures the field initialization is handled correctly, typically expected to be zero if not set otherwise.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of OrderLine.
  Act: Call the getVersion() method on the newly created instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is equal to 0 (assuming default uninitialized int value in Java).
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. The validation checks proper initialization ensuring no accidental alteration to versioning occurs without explicit intention.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Monitoring version default helps affirm system stability and data integrity in entity lifecycle management, particularly important in environments utilizing ORM or version-controlled persistence.

### Scenario 2: Set and retrieve version
Details:
  TestName: modifyAndRetrieveVersion
  Description: This test checks the functionality of setting a version number and then retrieving it, verifying that the setVersion and getVersion methods are mutually consistent.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of OrderLine and set a version number to a specific non-default value (e.g., 5).
  Act: Retrieve the version number using getVersion() method.
  Assert: Assert that the retrieved version number matches the number previously set.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: The test ensures that data set via setVersion is accurately stored and retrieved without corruption or unintended modifications.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Correct version tracking is critical in managing entity state transitions and can affect the integrity of transactions and persistence operations, making it essential for transactional integrity and concurrency control.

### Scenario 3: Version persistence through multiple modifications
Details:
  TestName: multipleVersionUpdates
  Description: This test assesses the robustness of the versioning system by applying multiple updates to the version field and checking the final value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an OrderLine instance and set the version multiple times (e.g., first to 3, then to 7).
  Act: Retrieve the final version value using getVersion() method.
  Assert: Verify that the final version number retrieved is the last value set.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: Checks that sequential updates to version are correctly handled and the most recent update persists.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: This ensures that the system can handle rapid and successive changes to entity states, maintaining accurate version control for operational and concurrency management.

These scenarios collectively ensure that version management via the getVersion() and setVersion() methods is consistent, reliable, and meets the basic functional requirements for an entity where versioning plays a critical role in its lifecycle and concurrency control.
