Scenario 1: Valid ISO Code Retrieval

Details:
  TestName: getIsoCodeWithValidCode
  Description: This test checks if the getIsoCode method correctly returns the ISO code that was set for the Country instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Country and set its isoCode using the setIsoCode method.
  Act: Call the getIsoCode method on the Country instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ISO code matches the one set during the arrangement step.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion verifies that the getIsoCode method returns the correct ISO code as set by the setIsoCode method.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensuring that the getIsoCode method correctly retrieves the ISO code is crucial for maintaining data integrity and correctness across systems that rely on this information.

Scenario 2: Null ISO Code Handling

Details:
  TestName: getIsoCodeWhenNotSet
  Description: This test verifies that the getIsoCode method returns null when the ISO code has not been set on the Country instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Country without setting an isoCode.
  Act: Call the getIsoCode method on the Country instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ISO code is null.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion checks that getIsoCode handles the absence of an isoCode gracefully by returning null.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: This test is important to confirm that the system behaves predictably and does not throw unexpected errors or exceptions when the ISO code is not available.

Scenario 3: ISO Code Consistency Check

Details:
  TestName: getIsoCodeConsistencyCheck
  Description: This test ensures that the getIsoCode method returns the same value upon multiple invocations, assuming no changes are made to the isoCode.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Country and set a specific isoCode.
  Act: Call the getIsoCode method twice on the same Country instance.
  Assert: Assert that both calls to getIsoCode return the same value.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion verifies that the getIsoCode method is consistent in its output when called multiple times under the same conditions.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensuring the consistency of the getIsoCode method is essential for debugging and reliability in scenarios where the same Country instance is accessed multiple times during execution.

Scenario 4: ISO Code Immutability Check

Details:
  TestName: getIsoCodeImmutabilityAfterExternalChange
  Description: This test checks whether changing the ISO code externally (through setIsoCode) after retrieving it affects the originally retrieved value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Country instance and set an initial isoCode. Retrieve this code and store it. Then, change the isoCode to a new value.
  Act: Compare the initially stored isoCode with the new isoCode.
  Assert: Assert that the originally stored isoCode remains unchanged.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion checks that the original isoCode value remains immutable despite changes made to the Country instance after its retrieval.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: This test is significant for ensuring that values retrieved from the getIsoCode method are not inadvertently affected by subsequent modifications to the Country object, preserving data integrity.
```
These scenarios cover basic functionality, error handling, and consistency checks for the getIsoCode method in the Country entity. Each test is designed to ensure that the method behaves as expected under various conditions, which is crucial for maintaining the reliability and robustness of the application.
