"""
  Scenario 1: Test to verify getIsoCode returns null when no IsoCode has been set

  Details:
    TestName: verifyGetIsoCodeReturnsNullWhenNotSet
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getIsoCode method correctly returns null when no IsoCode has been set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new instance of the Country class. Do not set the IsoCode.
    Act: Invoke the getIsoCode method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the result is null.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getIsoCode method correctly handles the case where no IsoCode has been set. The expected result is null because no IsoCode has been set. This test is significant as it verifies the correct behavior of the method in a scenario where the IsoCode is not set.

  Scenario 2: Test to verify getIsoCode returns the correct IsoCode when it has been set

  Details:
    TestName: verifyGetIsoCodeReturnsCorrectIsoCodeWhenSet
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getIsoCode method correctly returns the IsoCode that has been set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new instance of the Country class. Set the IsoCode to a known value.
    Act: Invoke the getIsoCode method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the result is equal to the known value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getIsoCode method correctly returns the IsoCode that has been set. The expected result is the known value because that is the value that was set. This test is significant as it verifies the correct behavior of the method when the IsoCode has been set.

  Scenario 3: Test to verify getIsoCode returns the latest IsoCode when it has been set multiple times

  Details:
    TestName: verifyGetIsoCodeReturnsLatestIsoCodeWhenSetMultipleTimes
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getIsoCode method correctly returns the latest IsoCode that has been set when the IsoCode has been set multiple times.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new instance of the Country class. Set the IsoCode to multiple known values, one after the other.
    Act: Invoke the getIsoCode method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the result is equal to the latest known value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getIsoCode method correctly returns the latest IsoCode that has been set. The expected result is the latest known value because that is the value that was last set. This test is significant as it verifies the correct behavior of the method when the IsoCode has been set multiple times.
