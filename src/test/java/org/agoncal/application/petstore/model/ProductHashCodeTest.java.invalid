```plaintext
Scenario 1: Two products with the same name and description should have the same hashCode

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeForIdenticalProducts
  Description: This test checks whether two Product instances with identical names and descriptions produce the same hashCode.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Product instances with the same 'name' and 'description' values.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on both Product instances.
  Assert: Assert that the hashCodes of both products are equal.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion verifies that the hashCode method is consistent and returns the same hash value for objects with identical data, which is crucial for correct behavior in hash-based collections.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensuring that identical objects have the same hash code is vital for the correct operation of hash-based data structures like HashSet or HashMap, where objects are stored and retrieved based on their hash codes.

Scenario 2: Two products with different names should have different hashCodes

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeForProductsWithDifferentNames
  Description: This test ensures that two Product instances with different 'name' values but the same 'description' produce different hashCodes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Product instances with different 'name' values and the same 'description'.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on both Product instances.
  Assert: Assert that the hashCodes of both products are not equal.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion checks that the hashCode method can differentiate between objects with different critical fields.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: This test is crucial for the correct functionality of collections that rely on hash codes to differentiate between elements, ensuring that distinct objects are treated separately.

Scenario 3: Two products with different descriptions should have different hashCodes

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeForProductsWithDifferentDescriptions
  Description: This test checks that two Product instances with the same 'name' but different 'description' values have different hashCodes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Product instances with the same 'name' but different 'description' values.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on both Product instances.
  Assert: Assert that the hashCodes of both products are not equal.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test verifies that the hashCode method considers different 'description' values to produce different hash codes.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: This test ensures that the hash code generation is sensitive to differences in non-identical objects, which is crucial for correct data handling in hash-based data structures.

Scenario 4: Consistency of hashCode on the same product instance

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeConsistencyCheck
  Description: This test verifies that repeated invocations of hashCode on the same Product instance return the same value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a single Product instance and set its 'name' and 'description'.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on this Product instance multiple times.
  Assert: Assert that all invocations return the same hashCode.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion checks the consistency of the hashCode computation, which should always produce the same output for the unchanged object state.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensuring the consistency of the hashCode across multiple calls is essential for the reliable operation of hash-based collections, where objects might be rehashed under certain operations.
