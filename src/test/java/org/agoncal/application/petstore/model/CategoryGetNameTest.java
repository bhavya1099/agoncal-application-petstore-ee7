Scenario 1: Test to check getName method return value

Details:  
  TestName: testGetNameReturnValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getName method is returning the correct value. The target scenario is when the name has been previously set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Category object and set its name using setName method.
    Act: Invoke the getName method on the created object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the name returned is same as the name set.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getName method is correctly returning the name that was set. The expected result is the same name that was set using the setName method. This test is significant in ensuring that the getName method is working correctly, as the name is a critical attribute of the Category object.

Scenario 2: Test to check getName method when name is null

Details:  
  TestName: testGetNameWhenNull
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getName method returns null when the name has not been set. The target scenario is when the name has not been set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Category object without setting its name.
    Act: Invoke the getName method on the created object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the name returned is null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getName method returns null when the name has not been set. The expected result is null. This test is significant in ensuring that the getName method handles null values correctly, as it can be a common scenario when the name has not been set.

Scenario 3: Test to check getName method with empty string

Details:  
  TestName: testGetNameWhenEmpty
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getName method returns an empty string when the name has been set as an empty string. The target scenario is when the name has been set as an empty string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Category object and set its name as an empty string using setName method.
    Act: Invoke the getName method on the created object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the name returned is an empty string.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getName method returns an empty string when the name has been set as such. The expected result is an empty string. This test is significant in ensuring that the getName method handles empty strings correctly, as it can be a common scenario when the name is intentionally set as an empty string.
