```plaintext
Scenario 1: Testing hashCode with a non-null name
Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithNonNullName
  Description: This test verifies that the hashCode method generates the correct hash code for a Category instance when the name attribute is set to a non-null value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Category object and set its name to a specific non-null string.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on the Category object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned hash code matches the expected hash code calculated using Objects.hash with the same name.
Validation:
  Validate that the hash code is consistent and correctly computed based on the non-null name attribute. This is important as it ensures that the hash function behaves as expected in collections relying on hash codes like HashSet or HashMap.
Scenario 2: Testing hashCode with null name
Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithNullName
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the hashCode method when the name attribute of the Category object is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Category object without setting its name (it remains null).
  Act: Call the hashCode method on the Category object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned hash code matches the expected hash code calculated using Objects.hash with a null value.
Validation:
  Validate that the method handles null values gracefully, returning a consistent hash code. This ensures that the Category objects with null names can be used in collections without causing errors due to hash code computation.
Scenario 3: Testing hashCode consistency on multiple invocations
Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeConsistency
  Description: This test ensures that multiple invocations of hashCode on the same object with an unchanged name return the same hash code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Category object and set its name to a specific string.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on the Category object multiple times.
  Assert: Verify that all invocations return the same hash code.
Validation:
  Confirm that the hashCode method is deterministic and provides consistent results when called multiple times with no changes in the object state. This consistency is crucial for the correct operation of hash-based collections.
Scenario 4: Testing hashCode with different names
Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithDifferentNames
  Description: This test checks that the hashCode method returns different hash codes for Category objects with different names.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Category objects with different names.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on both objects.
  Assert: Verify that the hash codes of the two objects are different.
Validation:
  Validate that the hash code is sensitive to changes in the name attribute, ensuring that different objects (by name) have different hash codes. This property is essential for the correct separation of entries in hash-based collections.
Scenario 5: Testing hashCode with identical names
Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithIdenticalNames
  Description: This test checks that the hashCode method returns the same hash code for Category objects with identical names.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Category objects and set their names to the same string value.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on both objects.
  Assert: Verify that the hash codes of both objects are identical.
Validation:
  Validate that the hash code computation correctly handles identical values by producing the same hash code, which is critical for managing collisions in hash-based data structures effectively.
