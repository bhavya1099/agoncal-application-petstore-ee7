ROOST_METHOD_HASH=hashCode_8d31c6ac7b
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashCode_44411a81c8

Scenario 1: Testing hashCode with same name
Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithSameName
  Description: This test is meant to check if the hashCode method returns the same hash code for two Category objects with the same name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Category objects with the same name.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both Category objects.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the two hash codes.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the hash codes are equal. The expected result is that the hash codes are equal because the names of the two Category objects are the same. This test is significant in the context of application behavior as it ensures that the hashCode method is working correctly when the names are the same.

Scenario 2: Testing hashCode with different names
Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithDifferentNames
  Description: This test is meant to check if the hashCode method returns different hash codes for two Category objects with different names.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Category objects with different names.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both Category objects.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the two hash codes.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the hash codes are different. The expected result is that the hash codes are different because the names of the two Category objects are different. This test is significant in the context of application behavior as it ensures that the hashCode method is working correctly when the names are different.

Scenario 3: Testing hashCode with null name
Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithNullName
  Description: This test is meant to check if the hashCode method returns zero when the name of the Category object is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Category object with a null name.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the Category object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the hash code with zero.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the hash code is zero. The expected result is that the hash code is zero because the name of the Category object is null. This test is significant in the context of application behavior as it ensures that the hashCode method is working correctly when the name is null.
