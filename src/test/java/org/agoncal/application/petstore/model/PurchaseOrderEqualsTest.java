```
Scenario 1: Test equality with same object instance

Details:
  TestName: testEqualityWithSameInstance
  Description: This test checks if the equals method returns true when the same object instance is compared with itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of PurchaseOrder.
  Act: Compare the PurchaseOrder instance with itself using the equals method.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns true.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test validates that an object is always equal to itself, following the reflexive property of the equals contract.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensuring object self-comparison handles correctly is fundamental for identity checks and collections operations.

Scenario 2: Test equality with two identical PurchaseOrder objects

Details:
  TestName: testEqualityWithIdenticalObjects
  Description: Checks if the equals method returns true for two different instances of PurchaseOrder with the same orderDate and customer values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two different instances of PurchaseOrder with identical orderDate and customer values.
  Act: Compare these two instances using the equals method.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns true.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test ensures that equals method defines equality based on the state (values of orderDate and customer) of the objects, not their references.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Critical for correct behavior in collections and when checking uniqueness based on object state rather than identity.

Scenario 3: Test inequality due to different orderDate

Details:
  TestName: testInequalityDueToDifferentOrderDate
  Description: This test checks that the equals method returns false for two PurchaseOrder objects differing in orderDate but having the same customer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two PurchaseOrder instances with the same customer but different orderDate values.
  Act: Use the equals method to compare these two instances.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test verifies the importance of orderDate in determining equality.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensures that the system recognizes orders as different if they occur on different dates, which is crucial for order tracking and reports.

Scenario 4: Test inequality due to different customer

Details:
  TestName: testInequalityDueToDifferentCustomer
  Description: This test verifies that the equals method returns false for two PurchaseOrder instances with the same orderDate but different customers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two PurchaseOrder instances with the same orderDate but different customers.
  Act: Compare these instances using the equals method.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns false.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Tests the impact of different customer objects on the outcome of the equality test.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Essential for ensuring that the system accurately identifies orders belonging to different customers, impacting user experience and order management.

Scenario 5: Test inequality with null

Details:
  TestName: testInequalityWithNull
  Description: This test checks whether the equals method returns false when comparing a PurchaseOrder object with null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of PurchaseOrder.
  Act: Compare this instance with null using the equals method.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Verifies that the equals method correctly handles null as per Java equals method contract.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Prevents potential NullPointerExceptions and ensures system stability when null comparisons occur inadvertently.
