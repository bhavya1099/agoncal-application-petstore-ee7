Scenario 1: Retrieve Home Address Successfully

Details: 
  TestName: testRetrieveHomeAddressSuccessfully
  Description: This test verifies that the getHomeAddress method returns the correct home address when it is set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a valid home address for the customer.
    Act: Call the getHomeAddress method.
    Assert: Verify that the returned home address matches the one set.
  Validation:
    This test ensures that the getHomeAddress method retrieves and returns the correct home address, validating the basic functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Retrieve Null Home Address

Details: 
  TestName: testRetrieveNullHomeAddress
  Description: This test checks if the getHomeAddress method returns null when no home address is set for the customer.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Do not set a home address for the customer.
    Act: Call the getHomeAddress method.
    Assert: Verify that the returned home address is null.
  Validation:
    This scenario validates that the getHomeAddress method behaves as expected when the customer does not have a home address.

Scenario 3: Retrieve Home Address After Update

Details:
  TestName: testRetrieveHomeAddressAfterUpdate
  Description: This test ensures that the getHomeAddress method returns the updated home address after it has been modified.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set an initial home address, update it, and then retrieve.
    Act: Call the getHomeAddress method.
    Assert: Verify that the returned home address matches the updated address.
  Validation:
    This test confirms that the getHomeAddress method reflects changes made to the home address, testing its ability to return the most recent address.

Scenario 4: Retrieve Home Address Multiple Times

Details:
  TestName: testRetrieveHomeAddressMultipleTimes
  Description: This test validates that calling the getHomeAddress method multiple times consecutively returns the same home address.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a home address for the customer.
    Act: Call the getHomeAddress method multiple times.
    Assert: Ensure that each call returns the same home address instance.
  Validation:
    By repeating the method call, this scenario ensures that the getHomeAddress method consistently returns the correct home address without any unexpected changes.

Scenario 5: Retrieve Home Address With Concurrent Updates

Details:
  TestName: testRetrieveHomeAddressWithConcurrentUpdates
  Description: This test simulates concurrent updates to the home address while attempting to retrieve it, checking for consistency.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set an initial home address and start concurrent threads to update the address.
    Act: Call the getHomeAddress method.
    Assert: Validate that the retrieved home address is consistent and unaffected by concurrent updates.
  Validation:
    This scenario tests the reliability of the getHomeAddress method under concurrent modification scenarios, ensuring data integrity.
