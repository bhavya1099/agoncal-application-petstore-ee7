ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashCode_6685cc0f7b

``` 
Scenario 1: Test hashCode Calculation Correctness

Details:  
  TestName: testHashCodeCalculationCorrectness
  Description: This test verifies that the hashCode method calculates the hash based on credit card number, type, and expiration date correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two CreditCard objects with the same credit card number, type, and expiration date.
    Act: Call the hashCode method on both objects.
    Assert: Ensure that the hash codes generated are the same for both objects.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that equal CreditCard objects produce the same hash code, which is crucial for consistent behavior in hash-based collections.

Scenario 2: Test hashCode Consistency

Details:  
  TestName: testHashCodeConsistency
  Description: This test checks whether the hashCode method consistently returns the same value for the same object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a CreditCard object.
    Act: Call the hashCode method multiple times on the same object.
    Assert: Verify that the hash code remains constant across multiple calls.
  Validation: 
    Consistency in hash code generation is vital for the stability of hash-based data structures and algorithms.

Scenario 3: Test hashCode Uniqueness

Details:  
  TestName: testHashCodeUniqueness
  Description: This test ensures that different CreditCard objects produce distinct hash codes.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two CreditCard objects with different credit card numbers, types, and expiration dates.
    Act: Call the hashCode method on both objects.
    Assert: Confirm that the hash codes generated are different for the two objects.
  Validation: 
    The test validates the uniqueness of hash codes to prevent collisions in hash-based collections.

Scenario 4: Test hashCode Collision Avoidance

Details:  
  TestName: testHashCodeCollisionAvoidance
  Description: This test validates that the hashCode method minimizes the likelihood of hash code collisions.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create multiple CreditCard objects with different attributes.
    Act: Call the hashCode method on all objects and compare the generated hash codes.
    Assert: Ensure that the likelihood of hash code collisions is low.
  Validation: 
    Hash code collisions can impact the performance of hash-based data structures, so this test aims to ensure the hash function distributes hash codes evenly.

Scenario 5: Test hashCode Performance

Details:  
  TestName: testHashCodePerformance
  Description: This test assesses the performance of the hashCode method under a large number of CreditCard objects.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a significant number of CreditCard objects.
    Act: Calculate the hash codes for all objects.
    Assert: Measure the time taken to compute the hash codes and verify it within an acceptable performance range.
  Validation: 
    Performance testing ensures that the hashCode method remains efficient even when processing a large dataset.
