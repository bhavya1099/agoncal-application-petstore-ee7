```plaintext
Scenario 1: Test hashCode with two identical CreditCard objects

Details:  
    TestName: testHashCodeWithIdenticalCreditCards
    Description: This test verifies that the hashCode method returns the same hash code for two CreditCard objects with identical field values.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create two CreditCard objects with the same creditCardNumber, creditCardType, and creditCardExpDate.
    Act: Calculate the hash code for both objects.
    Assert: Assert that both hash codes are equal.
Validation: 
    The assertion checks if the hashCode method adheres to the contract that equal objects must have identical hash codes. This is crucial for the correct functionality of hash-based collections like HashSet or HashMap.

Scenario 2: Test hashCode with different CreditCard objects

Details:  
    TestName: testHashCodeWithDifferentCreditCards
    Description: This test ensures that the hashCode method generates different hash codes for CreditCard objects with different field values.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create two CreditCard objects with different values for creditCardNumber, creditCardType, and/or creditCardExpDate.
    Act: Calculate the hash code for both objects.
    Assert: Assert that the hash codes are not the same.
Validation: 
    This test checks the proper implementation of the hashCode method to return different hash codes for non-equal objects, which helps in efficient bucketing in hash-based collections.

Scenario 3: Test hashCode consistency

Details:  
    TestName: testHashCodeConsistency
    Description: This test checks if repeated calls to hashCode on the same object return the same result, given that the object has not been modified.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a CreditCard object and calculate its hash code.
    Act: Calculate the hash code of the same object multiple times.
    Assert: Assert that all calculated hash codes are the same.
Validation: 
    Ensures that the hashCode method is consistent as per the general contract of hashCode. Consistency is vital for the correct operation in collections that use hashing.

Scenario 4: Test hashCode with null values in fields

Details:  
    TestName: testHashCodeWithNullValues
    Description: This test checks how the hashCode method handles CreditCard objects with null values in some or all fields.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a CreditCard object with null values for creditCardNumber, creditCardType, and/or creditCardExpDate.
    Act: Calculate the hash code for this object.
    Assert: Assert that a hash code is returned without throwing an exception.
Validation: 
    This test ensures robustness in the hashCode implementation to handle null values gracefully, preventing exceptions during operations in collections.

Scenario 5: Test hashCode with extreme values in fields

Details:  
    TestName: testHashCodeWithExtremeValues
    Description: This test examines the effect of using extreme or boundary values in CreditCard fields on the hash code generation.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a CreditCard object with extreme values for creditCardNumber (e.g., very long strings), and boundary enum values for creditCardType.
    Act: Calculate the hash code for this object.
    Assert: Assert that a hash code is generated.
Validation: 
    Checks the resilience of the hashCode method against extreme and boundary input values, ensuring the method's reliability across different data sets.
