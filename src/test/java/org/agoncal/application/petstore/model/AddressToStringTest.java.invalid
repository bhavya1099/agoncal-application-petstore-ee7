``` 
Scenario 1: Test toString method for Address with all fields populated

Details:  
  TestName: testToStringWithAllFieldsPopulated
  Description: Verify that the toString method returns a string representation of Address with all fields including street1, street2, city, state, zipcode, and country populated.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address object with all fields set.
    Act: Call the toString method on the Address object.
    Assert: Check if the returned string contains all the populated fields.
  Validation: 
    The assertion ensures that the toString method properly includes all relevant information of the Address object, which is crucial for debugging and logging purposes.

Scenario 2: Test toString method for Address with null fields

Details:  
  TestName: testToStringWithNullFields
  Description: Ensure that the toString method handles null fields correctly by returning a string representation of Address with null fields.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address object with some fields set to null.
    Act: Call the toString method on the Address object.
    Assert: Verify that the returned string contains the null fields.
  Validation: 
    This test verifies the robustness of the toString method in handling null values, preventing potential NullPointerExceptions and ensuring consistent behavior.

Scenario 3: Test toString method for Address with empty fields

Details:  
  TestName: testToStringWithEmptyFields
  Description: Validate that the toString method generates a string representation of Address with empty fields appropriately displayed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address object with some fields set to empty strings.
    Act: Invoke the toString method on the Address object.
    Assert: Confirm that the returned string includes the empty fields.
  Validation: 
    This scenario ensures that the toString method correctly represents Address instances with empty values, maintaining clarity in the output for empty fields.

Scenario 4: Test toString method for Address with only mandatory fields

Details:  
  TestName: testToStringWithMandatoryFields
  Description: Check that the toString method formats Address with only mandatory fields (street1, city, zipcode) correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Construct an Address object with mandatory fields populated.
    Act: Execute the toString method on the Address object.
    Assert: Validate that the resulting string includes only the mandatory fields.
  Validation: 
    By testing the toString method with essential data, we ensure that critical information is always present in the generated string representation.

Scenario 5: Test toString method for Address with country object

Details:  
  TestName: testToStringWithCountry
  Description: Verify that the toString method correctly includes the country information when available in the Address object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address object with a Country object set.
    Act: Call the toString method on the Address object.
    Assert: Check if the returned string contains the country information.
  Validation: 
    This test confirms that the toString method integrates the associated Country details, providing a comprehensive view of the Address object.

Scenario 6: Test toString method for Address with special characters in fields

Details:  
  TestName: testToStringWithSpecialCharacters
  Description: Ensure that the toString method handles special characters in fields and generates a valid string representation.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up an Address object with fields containing special characters.
    Act: Invoke the toString method on the Address object.
    Assert: Validate that the resulting string includes the special characters as expected.
  Validation: 
    Verifying the behavior of toString with special characters guarantees that the method correctly escapes or displays such characters in the output.
