Scenario 1: Test to verify the correct credit card type is returned
Details:
  TestName: testGetCreditCardType.
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the getCreditCardType() method returns the correct type of the credit card that has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CreditCard object and set a specific CreditCardType.
  Act: Invoke the getCreditCardType() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned CreditCardType matches the one that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getCreditCardType() method works as expected and returns the correct CreditCardType. This is significant in ensuring that the application correctly identifies the type of the credit card.

Scenario 2: Test to verify the default credit card type is returned when no type has been set
Details:
  TestName: testGetDefaultCreditCardType.
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the getCreditCardType() method returns the default CreditCardType when no type has been specifically set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CreditCard object without setting a CreditCardType.
  Act: Invoke the getCreditCardType() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned CreditCardType matches the default type.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getCreditCardType() method correctly returns the default type when no specific type has been set. This is important in cases where the type of the credit card is not specified.

Scenario 3: Test to verify the getCreditCardType() method when the CreditCard object is null
Details:
  TestName: testGetCreditCardTypeWhenObjectIsNull.
  Description: This test is designed to verify the behavior of the getCreditCardType() method when the CreditCard object is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Do not create a CreditCard object.
  Act: Attempt to invoke the getCreditCardType() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if a NullPointerException is thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that a NullPointerException is thrown when the getCreditCardType() method is invoked on a null object. This is significant as it ensures the application handles null objects appropriately.
