```plaintext
Scenario 1: Retrieve Valid Credit Card Type

Details:
  TestName: getValidCreditCardType
  Description: This test checks whether the getCreditCardType method correctly retrieves the credit card type when it has been previously set to a valid type.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of CreditCard and use setCreditCardType to set a valid CreditCardType (e.g., VISA).
  Act: Call the getCreditCardType method on the CreditCard instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned CreditCardType is the same as the one set.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion verifies the method returns the correct enum value corresponding to the set credit card type.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test to ensure the getter method properly retrieves stored enum values, crucial for payment processing validation and logic.

Scenario 2: Retrieve Null Credit Card Type

Details:
  TestName: getNullCreditCardType
  Description: This test verifies that the getCreditCardType method returns null when no credit card type has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of CreditCard without setting a credit card type.
  Act: Call the getCreditCardType method on the CreditCard instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned CreditCardType is null.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion checks for a null return value, which is expected behavior when no type has been set.
  Elaborate on the significance of this test to ensure the method handles scenarios where the credit card type is not yet specified, preventing potential errors in unhandled null values in business logic.

Scenario 3: Consistency Check for Credit Card Type Retrieval

Details:
  TestName: consistentCreditCardTypeRetrieval
  Description: This test ensures that multiple calls to getCreditCardType return the same result if the credit card type has not been changed between calls.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of CreditCard and set a specific CreditCardType (e.g., MASTERCARD). Retrieve the type once to confirm initial retrieval.
  Act: Call the getCreditCardType method multiple times on the same CreditCard instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if all retrieved types across calls are identical.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion verifies the getter's consistency over multiple invocations without state changes.
  Elaborate on the significance of this test to ensure the reliability and stability of the getter method in scenarios such as displaying the credit card type multiple times in a user interface without accidental modifications.
