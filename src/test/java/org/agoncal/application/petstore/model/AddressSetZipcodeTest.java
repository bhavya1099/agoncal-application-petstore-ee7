Scenario 1: Set Valid Zipcode
Details:
  TestName: setValidZipcode
  Description: This test checks if the setZipcode method correctly assigns a valid zipcode to the Address entity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class.
  Act: Call the setZipcode method on the instance with a valid zipcode string.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the zipcode field of the Address instance matches the string provided.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: The assertion checks that the zipcode field is set correctly when provided with valid input. This is significant as it ensures data integrity and correctness in address management.
Scenario 2: Set Null Zipcode
Details:
  TestName: setNullZipcode
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the setZipcode method when provided with a null value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class.
  Act: Call the setZipcode method on the instance with null.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that the zipcode field of the Address instance is set to null.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: The assertion checks that the method can handle null inputs without throwing an exception, which is crucial for avoiding runtime errors in applications that may process incomplete data.
Scenario 3: Set Empty Zipcode
Details:
  TestName: setEmptyZipcode
  Description: This test assesses whether the setZipcode method can handle an empty string input, setting the zipcode field accordingly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class.
  Act: Call the setZipcode method on the instance with an empty string.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the zipcode field of the Address instance is an empty string.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: The test confirms that the zipcode field can be explicitly set to an empty string, which might be used to denote unspecified zipcodes in certain contexts.
Scenario 4: Set Zipcode with White Spaces
Details:
  TestName: setZipcodeWithWhiteSpaces
  Description: This test verifies if the setZipcode method can handle a string containing only white spaces.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class.
  Act: Call the setZipcode method on the instance with a string of white spaces.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that the zipcode field of the Address instance matches the whitespace string.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: This ensures that the zipcode field accurately reflects inputs that consist solely of white spaces, which might be important for testing form submissions or user inputs in UI components.
