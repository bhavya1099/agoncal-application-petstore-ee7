"""
Scenario 1: Testing if zipcode is correctly set.
Details:   
  TestName: testSetZipcode.
  Description: This test is designed to check if the zipcode provided is correctly assigned to the instance variable.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create instance of the Class. Declare a String value for zipcode.
  Act: Invoke the setZipcode method with the declared zipcode.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual zipcode value against the expected one.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly sets the value of the instance variable zipcode. It's pivotal to test this to ensure that the property is in sync with the given input and the class instance is updated correctly.
Scenario 2: Testing if setting null zipcode is handled.
Details:   
  TestName: testSetNullZipcode.
  Description: This test is designed to verify that a null value for zipcode is managed properly without causing a null pointer exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class. Declare a null value for zipcode.
  Act: Invoke the setZipcode method with the declared null zipcode.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual zipcode value against null.
Validation: 
  The assertion would check if the instance variable is null, confirming that null inputs are handled properly. This test can help highlight potential exceptions or errors due to null input.
Scenario 3: Testing zipcode input with illegal characters.
Details:
  TestName: testSetZipcodeWithIllegalCharacters.
  Description: This test is to verify if the program executes correctly when a zipcode with illegal characters is input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class. Declare a zipcode with an illegal character.
  Act: Call the setZipcode method with the declared zipcode.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that an error or exception is thrown or the method return false (based on the method's mechanism to handle invalid input).
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that a zipcode with illegal characters is not accepted. This test ensures the data integrity of the zipcode input.
Scenario 4: Testing with excessively long zipcode.
Details:
  TestName: testSetExcessivelyLongZipcode.
  Description: This test is to verify how the method reacts when a zipcode of an excessively high length is input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class. Declare a zipcode of exceedingly high length.
  Act: Call the setZipcode method with the declared zipcode.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that an exception is thrown or the method returns false (as per method's handling procedure for invalid input length).
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that overly long zipcodes are not accepted. This is significant as zipcodes should adhere to a specific length standard (based on the country/region), which enhances data validity.
