```plaintext
Scenario 1: Set Valid Credit Card Type
Details:
  TestName: setValidCreditCardType
  Description: This test checks if the setCreditCardType method correctly assigns a valid CreditCardType enum to the creditCardType field.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the CreditCard entity and a valid CreditCardType enum value.
  Act: Call the setCreditCardType method on the CreditCard instance with the valid enum value.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to verify that the getCreditCardType method returns the same enum value that was set.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion confirms that the CreditCardType field is correctly updated with the new enum value.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensures that the setter method properly updates the type of the credit card, which is critical for processing transactions based on card type.
Scenario 2: Set Null Credit Card Type
Details:
  TestName: setNullCreditCardType
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the setCreditCardType method when null is passed as an argument, checking for potential NullPointerExceptions or other handling mechanisms.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the CreditCard entity.
  Act: Call the setCreditCardType method on the CreditCard instance with null as the parameter.
  Assert: Use assertNull to ensure that the getCreditCardType method returns null.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion checks that the creditCardType field can be set to null without causing errors, reflecting optional behavior for this field.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Important for understanding how the system behaves when the type of a credit card is unspecified, potentially impacting transaction validation or processing.
Scenario 3: Check Immutability of CreditCardType After Setting
Details:
  TestName: checkImmutabilityAfterSettingCreditCardType
  Description: Ensures that once the creditCardType is set, changing the original CreditCardType object does not affect the set credit card type.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the CreditCard entity and a CreditCardType enum. Set the creditCardType with this enum and then modify the original enum variable if mutable (hypothetical scenario for complex objects).
  Act: Retrieve the creditCardType from the CreditCard instance.
  Assert: Use assertSame to ensure that the retrieved CreditCardType is the same as the initially set value, confirming immutability.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Verifies that the internal state of the creditCardType field is protected from external changes after being set.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Critical for ensuring data integrity and consistency, particularly important in financial applications where data must remain reliable and unaltered.
Scenario 4: Repeated Setting of Credit Card Type
Details:
  TestName: repeatedlySetCreditCardType
  Description: This test checks the behavior of setting the creditCardType multiple times to different values and ensures the field updates correctly each time.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the CreditCard entity and multiple CreditCardType enum values.
  Act: Call the setCreditCardType method multiple times on the CreditCard instance with different enum values.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to verify that the getCreditCardType method returns the last set enum value.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Ensures that the creditCardType field can be updated multiple times and holds the latest value correctly.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Validates that the setter method properly handles updates, which is essential for scenarios where card information might need to be updated or corrected.
