Scenario 1: Test to check if getVersion method is returning correct version number

Details:  
  TestName: testGetVersionReturnsCorrectNumber
  Description: This test is designed to verify if the getVersion method of the Category class accurately retrieves the version number.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of Category and set its version to a known number.
    Act: Invoke the getVersion method on the Category instance.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned version number against the known version number.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that the version number returned by the getVersion method matches the known version number. The expected result is that both numbers are equal. This test is significant as it ensures that the version number can be accurately retrieved, which is crucial for version control and tracking changes in the Category.

Scenario 2: Test to check if getVersion method is returning default version number when not set

Details:  
  TestName: testGetVersionReturnsDefaultWhenNotSet
  Description: This test is designed to verify if the getVersion method of the Category class returns the default version number when it has not been set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of Category without setting its version.
    Act: Invoke the getVersion method on the Category instance.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned version number against the default version number.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that the version number returned by the getVersion method matches the default version number when not set. The expected result is that both numbers are equal. This test is significant as it ensures that the class behaves as expected when the version number is not explicitly set, thereby maintaining consistency and reliability in the application.

Scenario 3: Test to check if getVersion method is returning correct version number after updating

Details:  
  TestName: testGetVersionReturnsUpdatedNumber
  Description: This test is designed to verify if the getVersion method of the Category class accurately retrieves the updated version number.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of Category and set its version to a known number. Then, update the version number to a new known number.
    Act: Invoke the getVersion method on the Category instance.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned version number against the new known version number.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that the version number returned by the getVersion method matches the new known version number. The expected result is that both numbers are equal. This test is significant as it ensures that the version number can be accurately retrieved after updating, which is crucial for version control and tracking changes in the Category.
