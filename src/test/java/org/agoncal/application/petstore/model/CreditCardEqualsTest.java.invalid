``` 
Scenario 1: Test equality between two identical CreditCard objects

Details:  
  TestName: testEqualityBetweenIdenticalCreditCards
  Description: Verify that when comparing two identical CreditCard objects, the equals method returns true.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two CreditCard objects with the same credit card number, type, and expiration date.
    Act: Call the equals method on one object passing the other object as an argument.
    Assert: Ensure that the result is true.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies identical CreditCard objects based on all fields.
  
Scenario 2: Test equality between two different CreditCard objects

Details:  
  TestName: testInequalityBetweenDifferentCreditCards
  Description: Confirm that when comparing two different CreditCard objects, the equals method returns false.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two CreditCard objects with different credit card numbers, types, or expiration dates.
    Act: Invoke the equals method on one object with the other object as a parameter.
    Assert: Validate that the result is false.
  Validation: 
    The test ensures that the equals method distinguishes between different CreditCard objects based on any differing field values.

Scenario 3: Test equality with a non-CreditCard object

Details:  
  TestName: testInequalityWithNonCreditCardObject
  Description: Check that the equals method returns false when comparing a CreditCard object with a different type of object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a non-CreditCard object.
    Act: Call the equals method on a CreditCard object passing the non-CreditCard object as an argument.
    Assert: Verify that the result is false.
  Validation: 
    This scenario validates that the equals method correctly handles comparisons with objects of different types.

Scenario 4: Test equality with null object

Details:  
  TestName: testInequalityWithNullObject
  Description: Ensure that the equals method returns false when comparing a CreditCard object with null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Have a CreditCard object and set another object as null.
    Act: Invoke the equals method on the CreditCard object with null as the argument.
    Assert: Confirm that the result is false.
  Validation: 
    This test scenario checks the behavior of the equals method when comparing with a null object.

Scenario 5: Test equality with itself

Details:  
  TestName: testEqualityWithItself
  Description: Validate that the equals method returns true when comparing a CreditCard object with itself.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a CreditCard object.
    Act: Call the equals method on the object passing itself as an argument.
    Assert: Ensure that the result is true.
  Validation: 
    This scenario ensures that the equals method correctly identifies an object as equal to itself.

Scenario 6: Test equality with a CreditCard object with different fields

Details:  
  TestName: testInequalityWithDifferentFieldValues
  Description: Check that the equals method returns false when comparing CreditCard objects with different field values.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two CreditCard objects with differing credit card numbers, types, or expiration dates.
    Act: Invoke the equals method on one object with the other object as a parameter.
    Assert: Validate that the result is false.
  Validation: 
    The test confirms that the equals method correctly distinguishes between CreditCard objects with differing field values.
