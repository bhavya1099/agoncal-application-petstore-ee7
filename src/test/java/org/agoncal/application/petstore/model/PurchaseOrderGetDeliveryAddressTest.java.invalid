``` 
Scenario 1: Retrieve Delivery Address Successfully

Details:  
  TestName: testRetrieveDeliveryAddressSuccessfully
  Description: This test ensures that the getDeliveryAddress method returns the correct delivery address associated with the purchase order.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a PurchaseOrder object with a known delivery address.
    Act: Call getDeliveryAddress method on the PurchaseOrder object.
    Assert: Verify that the returned delivery address matches the one set during setup.
  Validation: 
    This test confirms that the getDeliveryAddress method correctly retrieves the delivery address, which is crucial for order fulfillment and shipping processes.

Scenario 2: Retrieve Null Delivery Address

Details:  
  TestName: testRetrieveNullDeliveryAddress
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of getDeliveryAddress when the delivery address is not set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a PurchaseOrder object with no delivery address set.
    Act: Call getDeliveryAddress method on the PurchaseOrder object.
    Assert: Ensure that the returned delivery address is null.
  Validation: 
    This test validates that the getDeliveryAddress method handles the case where no delivery address is assigned to the purchase order.

Scenario 3: Retrieve Updated Delivery Address

Details:  
  TestName: testRetrieveUpdatedDeliveryAddress
  Description: This test checks if the getDeliveryAddress method reflects any changes made to the delivery address.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a PurchaseOrder object and set an initial delivery address.
    Act: Modify the delivery address in the PurchaseOrder object.
    Assert: Call getDeliveryAddress and verify that the returned address is the updated one.
  Validation: 
    This test ensures that the getDeliveryAddress method dynamically retrieves the current delivery address, capturing real-time updates for accurate order processing.

Scenario 4: Retrieve Delivery Address Equality

Details:  
  TestName: testRetrieveDeliveryAddressEquality
  Description: This test confirms that the getDeliveryAddress method returns the same delivery address instance stored in the PurchaseOrder object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a PurchaseOrder object with a specific delivery address instance.
    Act: Call getDeliveryAddress method multiple times on the same PurchaseOrder object.
    Assert: Check that each invocation returns the exact reference to the delivery address object.
  Validation: 
    By verifying the equality of the returned address instance, this test ensures that the getDeliveryAddress method consistently provides access to the original delivery address without creating new instances.

Scenario 5: Retrieve Delivery Address Thread Safety

Details:  
  TestName: testRetrieveDeliveryAddressThreadSafety
  Description: This test assesses the thread safety of the getDeliveryAddress method when accessed concurrently.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a PurchaseOrder object with a shared delivery address among multiple threads.
    Act: Simultaneously call getDeliveryAddress from different threads.
    Assert: Validate that the method maintains consistency in returning the correct delivery address across all threads.
  Validation: 
    Ensuring the thread safety of getDeliveryAddress is crucial for applications with concurrent access, guaranteeing that the method behaves predictably and reliably under simultaneous requests.
