Scenario 1: Validate Successful Retrieval of Delivery Address

Details:  
  TestName: validateDeliveryAddressRetrieval
  Description: This test verifies that the getDeliveryAddress method correctly retrieves the delivery address associated with a PurchaseOrder instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a PurchaseOrder instance and set a known Address instance as its delivery address.
  Act: Call the getDeliveryAddress method on the PurchaseOrder instance.
  Assert: Assert that the retrieved Address is the same as the one set during the Arrange step.
Validation: 
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion checks if the Address returned by getDeliveryAddress is identical to the one initially set, ensuring the getter method functions correctly.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: This test is crucial to confirm that the PurchaseOrder can reliably provide its delivery address, which is fundamental for order processing and shipping logistics.

Scenario 2: Validate Null Delivery Address Retrieval

Details:  
  TestName: validateNullDeliveryAddressRetrieval
  Description: This test ensures that the getDeliveryAddress method correctly handles and returns null when no delivery address is set in the PurchaseOrder.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new PurchaseOrder instance without setting a delivery address.
  Act: Invoke the getDeliveryAddress method on the newly created PurchaseOrder instance.
  Assert: Assert that the result is null.
Validation: 
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test checks that the method returns null when there is no address set, confirming the method's robustness in handling such scenarios.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Itâ€™s essential to verify that the method can gracefully handle null values to prevent unexpected behavior or errors in parts of the application that depend on this method.

Scenario 3: Validate Delivery Address Integrity After Modification

Details:  
  TestName: checkDeliveryAddressIntegrityPostModification
  Description: This test checks if the getDeliveryAddress method returns an address that is not affected by external changes to the address object after it has been set to the PurchaseOrder.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a PurchaseOrder and an Address object. Set this address to the PurchaseOrder, then modify the address object's properties.
  Act: Retrieve the delivery address using getDeliveryAddress.
  Assert: Assert that the retrieved Address's properties match the initial values set before the modification.
Validation: 
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion ensures that changes to the Address object after it has been set do not affect the Address stored in the PurchaseOrder, indicating that the object's integrity is maintained.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensuring the integrity of the delivery address after its assignment to the PurchaseOrder is vital for maintaining accurate and consistent order and shipping details throughout the order lifecycle.
``` 

These scenarios provide a comprehensive approach to testing the `getDeliveryAddress` method, covering typical use cases, edge cases, and error handling to ensure the method's reliability and correctness in various operational contexts.
