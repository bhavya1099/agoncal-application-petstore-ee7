```
Scenario 1: Retrieve Product Name When Set

Details:
  TestName: getNameWhenNameIsSet
  Description: This test checks if the getName method correctly retrieves the name of the Product after it has been explicitly set using setName.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Product and set its name using setName method.
  Act: Retrieve the name using getName method.
  Assert: Assert that the retrieved name matches the name set in the arrange step.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the getName method accurately fetches the product's name as set by setName, ensuring the consistency and reliability of the Product entity's data handling. This is crucial for scenarios where product identification by name is required in the application.

Scenario 2: Retrieve Product Name When Not Set

Details:
  TestName: getNameWhenNameIsNotSet
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the getName method when the name has not been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Product without setting its name.
  Act: Retrieve the name using getName method.
  Assert: Assert that the retrieved name is null.
Validation:
  This test confirms that getName returns null if the name has not been set, which is expected behavior. It's important for handling cases where new Product instances might not have all properties initialized yet.

Scenario 3: Retrieve Product Name After Name Reset

Details:
  TestName: getNameAfterNameReset
  Description: This test checks if the getName method retrieves the correct name after the Product's name has been reset to a different value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Product, set its name, and then reset its name to a different value.
  Act: Retrieve the new name using getName.
  Assert: Assert that the retrieved name matches the new name set in the arrange step.
Validation:
  This test ensures that getName reflects updates to the Product's name, which is essential for dynamic environments where product details might change post-creation. It tests the mutability of the name field and the reliability of the getName method in reflecting such changes.

Scenario 4: Consistent Retrieval of Product Name

Details:
  TestName: consistentNameRetrieval
  Description: This test ensures that successive calls to getName return consistent results, assuming no intervening setName calls.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Product and set its name.
  Act: Retrieve the name using getName multiple times.
  Assert: Assert that all retrieved names are the same.
Validation:
  This test checks the consistency of the getName method over multiple invocations. It is crucial for ensuring that the Product entity's state is stable and reliable across different parts of the application where the product name is accessed frequently.
```

These scenarios cover various aspects of the `getName` method functionality, including its behavior when the name is set, not set, and reset, as well as the method's consistency across multiple calls. Each scenario helps ensure that the Product entity handles its name property correctly, which is vital for maintaining data integrity and reliability in applications using this entity.
