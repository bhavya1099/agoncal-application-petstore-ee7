Scenario 1: Retrieve Product Name Successfully

Details:
  TestName: getNameSuccessfully
  Description: Tests if the getName() method retrieves the correct product name as set via setName() when a valid name is assigned.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class and set a name using setName("Apple iPhone").
  Act: Call the getName() method on the instance.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to verify that the name returned by getName() is "Apple iPhone".
Validation:
  This test verifies that getName() correctly retrieves the name that was set, ensuring the consistency and reliability of name storage and retrieval mechanisms in the Product class.
  The significance of this test is to assure that Product instances accurately report stored names, which is fundamental for inventory management and display logic in applications using these objects.

Scenario 2: Default Name Value

Details:
  TestName: getNameWithDefaultNullValue
  Description: Tests the behavior of getName() when a Product instance is new and no name has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class without setting a name.
  Act: Call the getName() method on the newly created instance.
  Assert: Use assertNull to verify that the returned name is null.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the initial state of the 'name' field is null if not explicitly set, which is important for understanding object state on newly created Product instances.
  It is significant to know that fields not explicitly set should default to null, helping developers understand potential sources of null pointer exceptions or identify uninitialized objects.

Scenario 3: Name Field Integrity

Details:
  TestName: getNameAfterSettingMultipleTimes
  Description: Verifies that getName() returns the most recent name set using setName(), even after multiple invocations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class, set a name with setName("Old Name"), then update it by setting setName("New Name").
  Act: Call the getName() method on the instance.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to validate that the name returned is "New Name".
Validation:
  This test checks that setName() updates the name field correctly and that getName() retrieves the latest set value.
  Ensuring that subsequent updates to name are correctly stored and retrieved is critical for applications where product details might be edited and need to reflect the latest information.

Scenario 4: Resistance to External Modifications

Details:
  TestName: getNameImmutability
  Description: Tests if modifications to the String object returned by getName() do not alter the internal state of the Product object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class and set its name with setName("Immutable Name"), then retrieve this name and attempt to modify the original retrieved String.
  Act: Store the retrieved name in a variable, attempt to modify this variable, then call getName() again.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to ensure the name is still "Immutable Name".
Validation:
  This test verifies that String immutability in Java ensures that internal object state remains unchanged, which prevents accidental modification of object fields through references.
  Essential for ensuring the reliability and integrity of data within the Product entities, particularly when objects are accessed concurrently in a multi-threaded environment or where references are passed between methods or components.
```
This set of scenarios explores different angles of testing for the getName method in a Java class ensuring robustness and correctness of its functionality.
