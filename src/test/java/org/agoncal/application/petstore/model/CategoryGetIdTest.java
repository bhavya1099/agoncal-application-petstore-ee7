Scenario 1: Test that getId() returns the correct ID

Details:
  TestName: testGetIdReturnsCorrectId
  Description: This test is meant to check that the getId() method returns the correct ID when called.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Category object and set its ID using setId().
    Act: Invoke the getId() method on the Category object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual ID returned by getId() with the expected ID.
  Validation:
    The assertion is verifying that the ID returned by getId() matches the ID that was set using setId(). The expected result is that these IDs will match, as this is the basic functionality of a getter method. This test is significant as it verifies that the getId() method is correctly retrieving the ID from the Category object.

Scenario 2: Test that getId() returns null for a newly created Category object

Details:
  TestName: testGetIdReturnsNullForNewCategory
  Description: This test is meant to check that the getId() method returns null when called on a newly created Category object before setId() has been called.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new Category object without setting its ID.
    Act: Invoke the getId() method on the new Category object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the return value of getId() is null.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that getId() returns null when called on a Category object that has not had its ID set. This is the expected result as the default value of a Long object in Java is null. This test is significant as it verifies the initial state of a Category object and the behavior of the getId() method when the ID has not been set.

Scenario 3: Test that getId() returns the correct ID after the ID has been changed

Details:
  TestName: testGetIdReturnsUpdatedIdAfterChange
  Description: This test is meant to check that the getId() method returns the updated ID after the ID of a Category object has been changed using setId().
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Category object and set its ID using setId(). Then change the ID using setId() again.
    Act: Invoke the getId() method on the Category object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual ID returned by getId() with the updated ID.
  Validation:
    The assertion is verifying that the ID returned by getId() matches the updated ID that was set using setId(). The expected result is that these IDs will match, as this is the expected behavior when the ID is updated. This test is significant as it verifies that the getId() method is correctly retrieving the updated ID from the Category object.
