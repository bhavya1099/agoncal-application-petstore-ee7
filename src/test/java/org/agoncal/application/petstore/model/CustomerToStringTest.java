```plaintext
Scenario 1: All fields are non-null and properly formatted

Details:
    TestName: validateToStringWithFullDetails
    Description: This test will check if the toString method returns the correct string representation when all fields (firstName, lastName, login) are set properly.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Customer instance and set firstName, lastName, and login fields.
    Act: Call the toString method on the Customer instance.
    Assert: Verify that the output is "FirstName LastName (Login)".
Validation:
    The assertion checks that toString outputs the exact string format expected when all properties are adequately set. This confirms whether the method handles ordinary cases correctly by concatenating names and login within right format.
    It tests one of the most common scenarios for the functionality, ensuring that the basic format complies with the business expectation for displaying customer information.

Scenario 2: Fields are null

Details:
    TestName: validateToStringWithNullDetails
    Description: This test will check if the toString method handles null values correctly without throwing any exception.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Customer instance without setting firstName, lastName, and login fields (they should be null).
    Act: Call the toString method on this Customer instance.
    Assert: Verify that the output is "null null (null)" or it handles nulls in some expected format.
Validation:
    The assertion verifies that toString does not break with null inputs and handles them gracefully, which is crucial for the robustness of the application. It ensures that the application can handle cases where not all user details are provided or available.

Scenario 3: Fields have extra spaces or unusual characters

Details:
    TestName: validateToStringWithExtraSpaces
    Description: This test will check if the toString method correctly trims spaces or handles unusual characters in firstName or lastName.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Customer instance and set firstName and lastName with leading/trailing spaces, and login with some special characters.
    Act: Call the toString method on the Customer instance.
    Assert: Verify that the spaces are not trimmed (as this method does not inherently trim spaces or escape characters) and special characters are included as they are.
Validation:
    This assertion will confirm that toString method includes the exact characters provided, maintaining the integrity of user inputs. Such a test is significant to verify methodâ€™s behavior with non-standard inputs and that it faithfully represents the provided data.

Scenario 4: Extremely long strings

Details:
    TestName: validateToStringWithLongStrings
    Description: This test checks if the toString method can handle extremely long values in firstName, lastName, and login without truncation.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set firstName, lastName, and login to very long string values.
    Act: Call the toString method on the Customer instance.
    Assert: Verify that the output includes the entire strings without truncation.
Validation:
    Ensure toString does not truncate input values regardless of their length, which is critical for data integrity and correctness. It tests the method's capacity to handle data of varied lengths, which is vital for robustness in real-world scenarios.

/*
The test failure in question arises from a discrepancy between the expected and actual results of the `validateToStringWithExtraSpaces` method. The key line indicating the problem is:

```
org.junit.ComparisonFailure: Output should include extra spaces and unusual characters. expected:< John  []Doe  (john doe)> but was:< John  [ ]Doe  (john doe)>
```

From this, we can deduce that the issue stems from the handling of spaces in the `toString` implementation of the `Customer` class. In the test, the `Customer` object is instantiated with names containing leading and trailing spaces (`" John "` and `" Doe "`). The expected behavior, as specified in the test, is for these extra spaces to be reflected in the output of the `toString` method.

However, the actual result shows that there is an additional space between the first name and last name in the output. This suggests that the concatenation in the `toString` method doesn't account for or adjust any extra spaces that the input strings might contain. As a result, any spaces included at the ends of the `firstName` and `lastName` fields are preserved and reflected in the resulting string. This behavior leads to the actual output containing an unintended space between the first and last name.

The `toString` method in the `Customer` class is implemented as:

```java
@Override
public String toString() {
    return firstName + ' ' + lastName + " (" + login + ")";
}
```
Given the `firstName` and `lastName` inputs are `" John "` and `" Doe "`, the result is:
- `" John "` + `' '` + `" Doe "` which becomes `" John  Doe "` because both `firstName` and `lastName` contain trailing and leading spaces respectively.

The correct behavior would depend on whether the business logic dictates that such spaces should be trimmed. If spaces should be trimmed, they must be handled within the `toString` method or before setting these properties on the `Customer` object. In this scenario, the test fails because the actual behavior preserves spaces contrary to the expectations set in the test description.

This test case directly pinpoints a feature/bug (depending on the intended functionality) about handling string inputs with additional white spaces in the `Customer` class's `toString()` method implementation. Given the failure, it's advisable for the development team to either revisit the business rules regarding name formatting or adjust the test expectations in accordance with the defined functionality.
