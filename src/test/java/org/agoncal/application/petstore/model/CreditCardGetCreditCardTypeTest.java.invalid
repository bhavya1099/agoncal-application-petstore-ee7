  Scenario 1: Test to verify the correct CreditCardType is returned

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetCreditCardType
    Description: This test is designed to check whether the getCreditCardType() method returns the correct CreditCardType stored in the CreditCard object. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new CreditCard object and set a specific CreditCardType using setCreditCardType() method.
    Act: Invoke the getCreditCardType() method on the CreditCard object. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned CreditCardType matches the one set earlier.
  Validation: 
    This test verifies that the getCreditCardType() method accurately fetches the CreditCardType from the CreditCard object. This is important as it ensures the correct CreditCardType is used for subsequent operations.

  Scenario 2: Test to verify null is returned when CreditCardType is not set

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetCreditCardTypeWhenNotSet
    Description: This test checks if the getCreditCardType() method returns null when the CreditCardType has not been set in the CreditCard object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new CreditCard object without setting the CreditCardType.
    Act: Invoke the getCreditCardType() method on the CreditCard object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned CreditCardType is null.
  Validation: 
    This test verifies that the getCreditCardType() method correctly handles situations when the CreditCardType has not been set. This is important to avoid potential NullPointerExceptions in the application.

  Scenario 3: Test to verify the correct CreditCardType is returned after changing the CreditCardType

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetCreditCardTypeAfterChangingType
    Description: This test checks if the getCreditCardType() method returns the updated CreditCardType after it has been changed in the CreditCard object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new CreditCard object and set a specific CreditCardType. Then, change the CreditCardType to a different one.
    Act: Invoke the getCreditCardType() method on the CreditCard object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned CreditCardType matches the newly set CreditCardType.
  Validation: 
    This test verifies that the getCreditCardType() method accurately fetches the updated CreditCardType from the CreditCard object. This is crucial to ensure that the correct CreditCardType is used for subsequent operations after it has been changed.
