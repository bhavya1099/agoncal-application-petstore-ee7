Scenario 1: Test getting valid credit card type
Details:  
  TestName: testGettingValidCreditCardType
  Description: This test verifies that the getCreditCardType method returns the correct CreditCardType when a valid type is set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a CreditCard object and set a valid CreditCardType.
    Act: Call the getCreditCardType method on the CreditCard object.
    Assert: Ensure that the returned CreditCardType matches the one that was set.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that the getCreditCardType method correctly retrieves the CreditCardType set in the CreditCard object. It is crucial for maintaining data consistency and ensuring the accurate representation of credit card information.

Scenario 2: Test getting default credit card type
Details:  
  TestName: testGettingDefaultCreditCardType
  Description: This test checks if the getCreditCardType method returns a default CreditCardType when no type is explicitly set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a CreditCard object without setting a CreditCardType.
    Act: Call the getCreditCardType method on the CreditCard object.
    Assert: Verify that the returned CreditCardType is the default type.
  Validation: 
    The assertion ensures that the getCreditCardType method handles cases where no specific CreditCardType is assigned, providing a default value if necessary. This is essential for maintaining consistency and preventing unexpected behavior.

Scenario 3: Test getting credit card type after type change
Details:  
  TestName: testGettingCreditCardTypeAfterChange
  Description: This test confirms that the getCreditCardType method returns the updated CreditCardType after a type change operation.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a CreditCard object and set an initial CreditCardType. Change the CreditCardType to a different valid type.
    Act: Call the getCreditCardType method on the CreditCard object.
    Assert: Validate that the returned CreditCardType reflects the latest type change.
  Validation: 
    This assertion validates the functionality of getCreditCardType in capturing dynamic changes to the CreditCardType attribute. It ensures that the method fetches the most recent type value, supporting real-time updates in the application.

Scenario 4: Test getting credit card type with null type
Details:  
  TestName: testGettingCreditCardTypeWithNullType
  Description: This test examines the behavior of the getCreditCardType method when the CreditCardType is set to null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a CreditCard object and set the CreditCardType to null.
    Act: Invoke the getCreditCardType method on the CreditCard object.
    Assert: Check that the returned CreditCardType is null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion ensures that the getCreditCardType method correctly handles scenarios where the CreditCardType is intentionally set to null. This verification is essential for maintaining data integrity and preventing unexpected errors.

Scenario 5: Test getting credit card type consistency
Details:  
  TestName: testGettingCreditCardTypeConsistency
  Description: This test guarantees that the getCreditCardType method consistently retrieves the same CreditCardType under various circumstances.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a CreditCard object and set a specific CreditCardType.
    Act: Call the getCreditCardType method multiple times on the same CreditCard object.
    Assert: Confirm that each invocation of getCreditCardType returns the identical CreditCardType.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies the reliability and consistency of the getCreditCardType method in fetching the correct CreditCardType across repeated calls. Consistency in data retrieval is crucial for ensuring accurate information representation.
