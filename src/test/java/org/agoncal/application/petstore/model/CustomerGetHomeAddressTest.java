Scenario 1: Test to ensure getHomeAddress returns the correct address

Details:
  TestName: testGetHomeAddressReturnsCorrectAddress
  Description: This test is meant to check the getHomeAddress method to ensure it returns the correct home address that was previously set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Customer object and set a homeAddress.
  Act: Invoke the getHomeAddress method on the Customer object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned address against the address that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getHomeAddress method correctly retrieves the address that was set. The expected result is that the returned address matches the one that was set, ensuring the method is working as intended.

Scenario 2: Test to ensure getHomeAddress returns null if no address is set

Details:
  TestName: testGetHomeAddressReturnsNullIfNoAddressSet
  Description: This test is meant to check the getHomeAddress method to ensure it returns null if no address was set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Customer object without setting a homeAddress.
  Act: Invoke the getHomeAddress method on the Customer object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure the returned address is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getHomeAddress method correctly returns null if no address was set. The expected result is that the method returns null, ensuring it handles this edge case correctly.

Scenario 3: Test to ensure getHomeAddress returns the latest address if the address is updated

Details:
  TestName: testGetHomeAddressReturnsLatestAddressIfAddressUpdated
  Description: This test is meant to check the getHomeAddress method to ensure it returns the latest address if the home address is updated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Customer object and set a homeAddress. Then, update the homeAddress to a new address.
  Act: Invoke the getHomeAddress method on the Customer object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned address against the updated address.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getHomeAddress method correctly retrieves the latest address that was set. The expected result is that the returned address matches the updated one, ensuring the method is working as intended even after the address is updated.
