```
Scenario 1: Valid Home Address Retrieval

Details:
  TestName: getValidHomeAddress
  Description: Tests that the getHomeAddress method correctly returns a non-null, valid Address instance when the home address has been previously set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Customer instance and set a valid Address instance to the homeAddress field.
  Act: Call getHomeAddress method on the Customer instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned Address instance is not null and check if some expected properties (like street or city) match the set values.
Validation:
  Clarify that the returned Address should correctly reflect the Address instance that was set. This test validates the functionality of the getHomeAddress getter method in retrieving the correct field value.
  Elaborate on the significance: Ensures that the system provides accurate address details for customer entities, which is crucial for billing, communication, or legal purposes.

Scenario 2: Null Home Address Retrieval

Details:
  TestName: getNullHomeAddress
  Description: Verify that the getHomeAddress method returns null when no address has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Customer instance without setting the homeAddress field.
  Act: Invoke the getHomeAddress method on the Customer instance.
  Assert: Assert that the result is null.
Validation:
  Clarify that the method should accurately return null when the homeAddress has not been set, showcasing proper handling of default uninitialized fields.
  Elaborate on the significance: This test is crucial to ensure that the application can gracefully handle and represent customers who have not provided their address information.

Scenario 3: Home Address Consistency after Customer Modification

Details:
  TestName: checkHomeAddressConsistencyAfterModification
  Description: Tests if the home address remains consistent on a Customer instance after modifying other non-related fields of the Customer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a Customer instance with a specific home address and other fields. Change a non-related field (e.g., firstName) after the home address is set.
  Act: Retrieve the home address using getHomeAddress method after the modification.
  Assert: Verify that the home address retrieved is still the same as the one originally set, unchanged.
Validation:
  Clarify that updates to other fields should not alter the homeAddress field value. It ensures that the method correctly isolates and fetches only the relevant field data.
  Elaborate on the significance: This test ensures data integrity and isolation, critical for maintaining accurate customer records and preventing data bleed in a multi-field entity like Customer.
```

These scenarios cover several functional and integrity aspects of the getHomeAddress method within the Customer class, ensuring proper handling and storage of crucial customer data.

/*
The test case `getNullHomeAddress` is designed to verify that the `getHomeAddress` method of the `Customer` class returns `null`. However, the test is failing because the actual behavior of the `getHomeAddress` method does not align with what the test anticipates. 

In the initialization of a `Customer` object, based on the constructor provided, the `homeAddress` field is always initialized with a new `Address` instance (either with default values as shown by `new Address()` without any parameters or another constructor setting it explicitly if provided). Therefore, the `homeAddress` field of a `Customer` is never `null` by default. It will at least contain an `Address` object with all fields set to `null` or default values, which corresponds with the `Address` output shown: `<Address{street1='null', street2='null', city='null', state='null', zipcode='null', country=null}>`.

The error in the test originates from the assertion `assertNull("Address should be null", result);` which expects the `homeAddress` to be `null`. The correct result based on the current implementation of the `Customer` class is an `Address` object with uninitialized fields. To fix this issue, the test needs to be revised to reflect the actual expected outcome, which should be to verify that `getHomeAddress` returns a non-null `Address` object, or the initialization in the `Customer` class should be amended if the intention truly was for `homeAddress` to be `null`.

Thus, this is a logical error related to what the code is expected by the test to do versus what it is actually programmed to do. This discrepancy makes the test fail its assertion, leading to the described test failure.
