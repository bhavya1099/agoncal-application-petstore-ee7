```
Scenario 1: Retrieving a non-null home address

Details:
  TestName: retrieveNonNullHomeAddress
  Description: This test checks if the getHomeAddress method returns a non-null Address object when the home address is already set in the Customer object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Customer object and set a valid Address object to its homeAddress field.
  Act: Call the getHomeAddress method on the Customer object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned Address object is not null.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the method correctly retrieves the Address object associated with the customer. It ensures that the getHomeAddress method functions correctly when the home address is properly set, reflecting correct behavior in real-world usage where a customer typically has an address.

Scenario 2: Retrieving a null home address

Details:
  TestName: retrieveNullHomeAddress
  Description: This test verifies whether the getHomeAddress method returns null when the home address is not set (i.e., is null) in the Customer object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Customer object without setting a home address.
  Act: Call the getHomeAddress method on the Customer object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned Address object is null.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the getHomeAddress method handles cases where no home address is set, returning null as expected. This scenario is significant for situations where new or incomplete customer profiles are handled by the application.

Scenario 3: Consistency of returned home address

Details:
  TestName: checkConsistencyOfReturnedHomeAddress
  Description: This test checks if the getHomeAddress method consistently returns the same Address object for multiple invocations, assuming no changes in between calls.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Customer object and set a specific Address object to its homeAddress field.
  Act: Call the getHomeAddress method twice on the same Customer object.
  Assert: Assert that both returned Address objects are the same.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getHomeAddress method returns a consistent result across multiple calls without any modification to the underlying data. This is crucial for ensuring data integrity and consistency throughout the application's operation.

Scenario 4: Effect of setting a new home address

Details:
  TestName: effectOfSettingNewHomeAddress
  Description: This test evaluates if updating the home address of a Customer object is accurately reflected when getHomeAddress is called subsequently.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Customer object and set an initial Address object. Update the homeAddress field with a new Address object.
  Act: Call the getHomeAddress method after the update.
  Assert: Assert that the returned Address object matches the new Address object set.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the getHomeAddress method accurately reflects updates to the homeAddress field of the Customer object. This test is critical to ensure that changes to customer information are properly managed and retrieved, which is a common requirement in customer management systems.
