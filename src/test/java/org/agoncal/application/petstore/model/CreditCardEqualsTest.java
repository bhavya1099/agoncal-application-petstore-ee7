Scenario 1: Test to check if the equals method correctly identifies two identical CreditCard objects

Details:
  TestName: testEqualsForIdenticalObjects
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies two identical CreditCard objects. The test creates two identical CreditCard objects and compares them using the equals method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two CreditCard objects with the same creditCardNumber, creditCardType, and creditCardExpDate.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on one of the objects, passing the other as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is true.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies two identical CreditCard objects. This is crucial as it ensures the correct functioning of any operations relying on object equality, such as searching or sorting.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the equals method correctly identifies two different CreditCard objects

Details:
  TestName: testEqualsForDifferentObjects
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies two different CreditCard objects. The test creates two CreditCard objects with different creditCardNumber, creditCardType, or creditCardExpDate and compares them using the equals method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two CreditCard objects with different creditCardNumber, creditCardType, or creditCardExpDate.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on one of the objects, passing the other as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies two different CreditCard objects. This is crucial as it ensures the correct functioning of any operations relying on object inequality, such as filtering or removing duplicates.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the equals method correctly handles a null object

Details:
  TestName: testEqualsForNullObject
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly handles a null object. The test invokes the equals method on a CreditCard object, passing null as a parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CreditCard object.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on the object, passing null as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly handles a null object. This is crucial as it prevents potential NullPointerExceptions when comparing objects.
