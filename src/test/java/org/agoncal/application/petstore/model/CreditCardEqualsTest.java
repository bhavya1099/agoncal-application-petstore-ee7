Here are the test scenarios for the `equals` method:
**Scenario 1: Same Object Comparison**
Details:
TestName: compareSameObject
Description: Test that the `equals` method returns true when comparing an object with itself.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a `CreditCard` object with some valid data.
Act: Call the `equals` method on the object with itself as the parameter.
Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation: This test verifies that the `equals` method correctly handles the case where the object is compared with itself, which is a fundamental aspect of the equals contract.
**Scenario 2: Different Object Comparison**
Details:
TestName: compareDifferentObject
Description: Test that the `equals` method returns false when comparing two different objects.
Execution:
Arrange: Create two separate `CreditCard` objects with different data.
Act: Call the `equals` method on one object with the other object as the parameter.
Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation: This test verifies that the `equals` method correctly handles the case where two different objects are compared.
**Scenario 3: Null Comparison**
Details:
TestName: compareWithNull
Description: Test that the `equals` method returns false when comparing with null.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a `CreditCard` object with some valid data.
Act: Call the `equals` method on the object with null as the parameter.
Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation: This test verifies that the `equals` method correctly handles the case where the object is compared with null.
**Scenario 4: Different Class Comparison**
Details:
TestName: compareDifferentClass
Description: Test that the `equals` method returns false when comparing with an object of a different class.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a `CreditCard` object with some valid data and an object of a different class (e.g., String).
Act: Call the `equals` method on the `CreditCard` object with the object of the different class as the parameter.
Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation: This test verifies that the `equals` method correctly handles the case where the object is compared with an object of a different class.
**Scenario 5: CreditCardNumber Comparison**
Details:
TestName: compareCreditCardNumber
Description: Test that the `equals` method returns true when the creditCardNumber field is the same.
Execution:
Arrange: Create two `CreditCard` objects with the same creditCardNumber and different other fields.
Act: Call the `equals` method on one object with the other object as the parameter.
Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation: This test verifies that the `equals` method correctly handles the case where the creditCardNumber field is the same.
**Scenario 6: CreditCardType Comparison**
Details:
TestName: compareCreditCardType
Description: Test that the `equals` method returns true when the creditCardType field is the same.
Execution:
Arrange: Create two `CreditCard` objects with the same creditCardType and different other fields.
Act: Call the `equals` method on one object with the other object as the parameter.
Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation: This test verifies that the `equals` method correctly handles the case where the creditCardType field is the same.
**Scenario 7: CreditCardExpDate Comparison**
Details:
TestName: compareCreditCardExpDate
Description: Test that the `equals` method returns true when the creditCardExpDate field is the same.
Execution:
Arrange: Create two `CreditCard` objects with the same creditCardExpDate and different other fields.
Act: Call the `equals` method on one object with the other object as the parameter.
Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation: This test verifies that the `equals` method correctly handles the case where the creditCardExpDate field is the same.
**Scenario 8: All Fields Comparison**
Details:
TestName: compareAllFields
Description: Test that the `equals` method returns true when all fields are the same.
Execution:
Arrange: Create two `CreditCard` objects with the same data.
Act: Call the `equals` method on one object with the other object as the parameter.
Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation: This test verifies that the `equals` method correctly handles the case where all fields are the same.
**Scenario 9: None of the above**
Details:
TestName: compareNoneOfTheAbove
Description: Test that the `equals` method returns false when none of the above conditions are met.
Execution:
Arrange: Create two `CreditCard` objects with different data.
Act: Call the `equals` method on one object with the other object as the parameter.
Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation: This test verifies that the `equals` method correctly handles the case where none of the above conditions are met.
Note that these test scenarios cover all possible combinations of the fields and edge cases, ensuring that the `equals` method is thoroughly tested.
