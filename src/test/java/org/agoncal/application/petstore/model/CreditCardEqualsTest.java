Scenario 1: Two CreditCard objects with identical properties
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithIdenticalProperties
  Description: This test checks if the equals method returns true when comparing two CreditCard objects with the same credit card number, type, and expiration date.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two CreditCard objects with the same values for creditCardNumber, creditCardType, and creditCardExpDate.
  Act: Call the equals method on one of the CreditCard objects, passing the other as an argument.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is true.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies objects as equivalent when all their properties match.
  Elaborate on the significance of this test to ensure that the system correctly recognizes and processes identical credit cards as the same entity, which is crucial for avoiding duplicate records or errors in transaction processing.
Scenario 2: Two CreditCard objects with different credit card numbers
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentCreditCardNumbers
  Description: This test checks if the equals method returns false when comparing two CreditCard objects that differ only by their credit card numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two CreditCard objects with different values for creditCardNumber but identical creditCardType and creditCardExpDate.
  Act: Call the equals method on one of the CreditCard objects, passing the other as an argument.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion verifies that the equals method can correctly differentiate between objects based on their credit card number.
  Elaborate on the importance of this test to ensure that the system treats credit cards with different numbers as distinct entities, which is essential for accurate user identification and financial transactions.
Scenario 3: Comparison with null
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithNull
  Description: This test checks if the equals method returns false when comparing a CreditCard object with null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CreditCard object and use null for the comparison.
  Act: Call the equals method on the CreditCard object, passing null as an argument.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion verifies that the equals method handles null correctly, ensuring that no NullPointerException is thrown and the method returns false.
  Elaborate on the significance of this test in preventing errors when null values are encountered during data processing or comparisons.
Scenario 4: Comparison with a non-CreditCard object
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithNonCreditCardObject
  Description: This test checks if the equals method returns false when comparing a CreditCard object with an object of a different class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CreditCard object and an object of another class (e.g., String).
  Act: Call the equals method on the CreditCard object, passing the non-CreditCard object as an argument.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion verifies that the equals method can correctly identify objects of different classes as unequal.
  Elaborate on the significance of this test to ensure type safety and correctness in comparisons, which helps avoid runtime errors and incorrect data processing.
Scenario 5: Self-comparison of a CreditCard object
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithSelf
  Description: This test checks if the equals method returns true when a CreditCard object is compared with itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a single CreditCard object.
  Act: Call the equals method on the CreditCard object, passing itself as an argument.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is true.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies an object as equal to itself, which is a fundamental property of equivalence relations.
  Elaborate on the significance of this test in ensuring the basic correctness of the equals method implementation, which is crucial for consistent behavior in collections and other data structures that rely on object equality.
