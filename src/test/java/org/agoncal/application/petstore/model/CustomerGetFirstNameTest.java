Scenario 1: Test to verify that getFirstName returns the correct first name of the Customer

Details:
  TestName: testGetFirstNameReturnsCorrectName.
  Description: This test is meant to check that the getFirstName method correctly returns the first name of the customer. The target scenario is when a customer's first name has been set and the getFirstName method is invoked.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Customer object and set the first name using the setFirstName method.
  Act: Invoke the getFirstName method on the Customer object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value with the expected first name.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getFirstName method correctly returns the first name that was set on the Customer object. The expected result is the same name that was set using the setFirstName method. This test is significant in ensuring that the application can correctly retrieve a customer's first name.

Scenario 2: Test to verify that getFirstName returns null when the first name has not been set

Details:
  TestName: testGetFirstNameReturnsNullWhenNotSet.
  Description: This test is meant to check that the getFirstName method returns null when the customer's first name has not been set. The target scenario is when a new Customer object is created but the first name is not set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Customer object without setting the first name.
  Act: Invoke the getFirstName method on the Customer object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getFirstName method correctly handles the case when the first name has not been set and returns null. This test is important in ensuring that the application can handle cases where certain customer details may not have been provided.

Scenario 3: Test to verify that getFirstName returns the correct first name after it has been changed

Details:
  TestName: testGetFirstNameReturnsCorrectNameAfterChange.
  Description: This test is meant to check that the getFirstName method correctly returns the updated first name of the customer after it has been changed. The target scenario is when a customer's first name has been changed and the getFirstName method is invoked.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Customer object and set the first name. Then change the first name by invoking the setFirstName method with a new name.
  Act: Invoke the getFirstName method on the Customer object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value with the new first name.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getFirstName method correctly returns the updated first name. The expected result is the new name that was set using the setFirstName method. This test is significant in ensuring that the application correctly tracks changes to a customer's first name.
