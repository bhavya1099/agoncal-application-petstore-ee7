Scenario 1: Valid CreditCard Object Representation

Details:
  TestName: toStringWithValidDetails
  Description: Ensure the toString() method correctly formats the string when all fields in the CreditCard object are valid and populated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create and set up a fully populated CreditCard object with all required fields: creditCardNumber, creditCardType, and creditCardExpDate.
  Act: Call the toString() method on this populated CreditCard object.
  Assert: Verify that the output string matches the expected format "CreditCard{creditCardNumber='1234567890123456', creditCardType=VISA, creditCardExpDate='12/24'}".
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion checks that the string representation correctly includes all fields in the specified format.
  Elaborate on the importance of this test for debugging and logging purposes, ensuring that credit card details are displayed consistently and as expected.

Scenario 2: CreditCard Object with Null Values

Details:
  TestName: toStringWithNullValues
  Description: Test the toString() method's response when some fields in the CreditCard object are null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CreditCard object and set only creditCardNumber, leave creditCardType and creditCardExpDate as null.
  Act: Invoke the toString() method on this partially populated CreditCard object.
  Assert: Check if the output string correctly handles null values, expecting a format like "CreditCard{creditCardNumber='1234567890123456', creditCardType=null, creditCardExpDate=null}".
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion verifies the method's ability to gracefully handle null fields without throwing errors, and ensure proper formatting of the output string.
  Emphasize the scenario's significance in cases where some credit card information might not be available or is pending input from the user.

Scenario 3: Empty CreditCard Object

Details:
  TestName: toStringWithEmptyFields
  Description: Evaluate the output of the toString() method when all fields in the CreditCard object are empty or unset.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a new CreditCard object without setting any fields (all fields remain null or default).
  Act: Call the toString() method on this empty CreditCard object.
  Assert: Confirm that the result matches "CreditCard{creditCardNumber=null, creditCardType=null, creditCardExpDate=null}".
Validation:
  The assertion makes sure the method can handle cases where all CreditCard fields are defaults or null, ensuring no exceptions are thrown and the resulting string is as expected.
  Discuss the importance of this test for scenario completeness and error-proofing the CreditCard class functionality, particularly in uninitialized object states.
```
These scenarios encompass typical, edge, and error conditions for `toString()` method behavior in a robust class like `CreditCard`, ensuring that the method behaves as expected across various object states.

/*
The test `toStringWithNullValues()` in the `CreditCardToStringTest` class is failing due to a mismatch in the expected and actual output of the string representation of a `CreditCard` object when certain fields are set to null. The critical point here is how Java handles the `toString()` output of `null` values concatenated as strings.

**Detailed Explanation:**  
In the provided error report, the failure is described by the assertion error:
```org.junit.ComparisonFailure: expected:<..., creditCardExpDate=[null]}> but was:<..., creditCardExpDate=['null']}>```

This indicates that the expected string does not match the actual output string from the `CreditCard` object's `toString()` method. The testing framework anticipates the `null` values to be present unquoted (`null`), but in the output, they are appearing single-quoted as strings (`'null'`).

**Why this difference occurs:**
- The `toString()` method implementation in `CreditCard` class is likely converting `null` values to the string `"null"` because it involves concatenation of string with `null` which in Java results in "null" as a string literal.
  
- This distinction often arises from how Java handles string concatenation involving `null`. When you concatenate a string literal with a `null`, Java converts `null` to `"null"`. Hence, in `CreditCard` class, `toString()` method as defined:
  ```java
  public String toString() {
      return "CreditCard{" + "creditCardNumber='" + creditCardNumber + '\'' + ", creditCardType=" + creditCardType + ", creditCardExpDate='" + creditCardExpDate + '\'' + '}';
  }
  ```
  When `creditCardExpDate` is `null`, this translates to `'null'` instead of being the raw `null`.

**Fix Recommendation:**
- Adjust the expected string in the unit test to match the output of the `toString()` method, factoring in how Java treats string concatenation with `null`, or
- Modify the `toString()` method in `CreditCard` to handle `null` values differently, if a specific format (like actual `null` without quotes) is needed for these fields.

The issue here purely resides in the mismatch of expected outcome due to Java's default string concatenation behavior with null fields. It is noted that this behavior is consistent and expected given Java's handling of strings and `null` values.

    assertEquals(expected, creditCard.toString());

/*
The primary reason the test `toStringWithEmptyFields` is failing is due to a mismatch in the expected and actual output of the `CreditCard.toString()` method when all the fields in the `CreditCard` object are `null`. 

In your test case:
- The expected string is `"CreditCard{creditCardNumber=null, creditCardType=null, creditCardExpDate=null}"`.
- However, the actual output from the `toString()` method on the `CreditCard` object appears to be `"CreditCard{creditCardNumber='null', creditCardType=null, creditCardExpDate='null'}"`.

The difference lies in how the `null` values are represented as strings. In the expected output, `null` values are unquoted which suggests they are directly converted to the string `"null"`. But in the actual output, the `null` values are quoted as `'null'`, which implies that the `null` values are being processed in such a way (probably by `toString()` code handling) that they are treated as the string `"null"` rather than `null` the data type.

This discrepancy between expected and actual output results in the test failure, as `assertEquals` is strict about the string equality, including how `null` values are represented within the string.

To fix this issue, ensure that the representation of null values in the `toString()` method aligns with the expected format, either by adjusting the `toString()` method or updating the expected string in the unit test to match the output from `toString()`. The exact approach depends on the desired representation of null values in your application's context.
