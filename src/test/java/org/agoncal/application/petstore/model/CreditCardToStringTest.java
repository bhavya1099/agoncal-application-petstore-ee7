```markdown
Scenario 1: Valid CreditCard Object Representation

Details:
  TestName: toStringWithValidDetails
  Description: Ensure the toString() method correctly formats the string when all fields in the CreditCard object are valid and populated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create and set up a fully populated CreditCard object with all required fields: creditCardNumber, creditCardType, and creditCardExpDate.
  Act: Call the toString() method on this populated CreditCard object.
  Assert: Verify that the output string matches the expected format "CreditCard{creditCardNumber='1234567890123456', creditCardType=VISA, creditCardExpDate='12/24'}".
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion checks that the string representation correctly includes all fields in the specified format.
  Elaborate on the importance of this test for debugging and logging purposes, ensuring that credit card details are displayed consistently and as expected.

Scenario 2: CreditCard Object with Null Values

Details:
  TestName: toStringWithNullValues
  Description: Test the toString() method's response when some fields in the CreditCard object are null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CreditCard object and set only creditCardNumber, leave creditCardType and creditCardExpDate as null.
  Act: Invoke the toString() method on this partially populated CreditCard object.
  Assert: Check if the output string correctly handles null values, expecting a format like "CreditCard{creditCardNumber='1234567890123456', creditCardType=null, creditCardExpDate=null}".
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion verifies the method's ability to gracefully handle null fields without throwing errors, and ensure proper formatting of the output string.
  Emphasize the scenario's significance in cases where some credit card information might not be available or is pending input from the user.

Scenario 3: Empty CreditCard Object

Details:
  TestName: toStringWithEmptyFields
  Description: Evaluate the output of the toString() method when all fields in the CreditCard object are empty or unset.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a new CreditCard object without setting any fields (all fields remain null or default).
  Act: Call the toString() method on this empty CreditCard object.
  Assert: Confirm that the result matches "CreditCard{creditCardNumber=null, creditCardType=null, creditCardExpDate=null}".
Validation:
  The assertion makes sure the method can handle cases where all CreditCard fields are defaults or null, ensuring no exceptions are thrown and the resulting string is as expected.
  Discuss the importance of this test for scenario completeness and error-proofing the CreditCard class functionality, particularly in uninitialized object states.
```
These scenarios encompass typical, edge, and error conditions for `toString()` method behavior in a robust class like `CreditCard`, ensuring that the method behaves as expected across various object states.
