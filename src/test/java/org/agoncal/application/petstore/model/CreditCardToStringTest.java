Scenario 1: Validate the string representation of a CreditCard object

Details:
  TestName: validateCreditCardToStringRepresentation
  Description: This test aims to validate the string representation of a CreditCard object. The toString method should return a string that accurately represents the state of the object.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CreditCard object with a specific credit card number, type, and expiration date.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the CreditCard object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned string matches the expected string representation of the CreditCard object.

Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the toString method accurately represents the state of the CreditCard object. The expected result is a string that includes the credit card number, type, and expiration date. This test is significant because it ensures that the toString method provides a meaningful and accurate representation of the object, which can be useful for debugging and logging purposes.

Scenario 2: Validate the string representation of a CreditCard object with null fields

Details:
  TestName: validateCreditCardToStringRepresentationWithNullFields
  Description: This test aims to validate the string representation of a CreditCard object when some of its fields are null. The toString method should handle null fields gracefully and not throw a NullPointerException.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CreditCard object with a specific credit card number and type, but set the expiration date to null.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the CreditCard object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned string matches the expected string representation of the CreditCard object, with the null field represented as 'null'.

Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the toString method can handle null fields without throwing a NullPointerException. The expected result is a string that includes the credit card number, type, and 'null' for the expiration date. This test is significant because it ensures that the toString method is robust and can handle all possible states of the CreditCard object.

Scenario 3: Validate the string representation of an empty CreditCard object

Details:
  TestName: validateToStringRepresentationOfEmptyCreditCard
  Description: This test aims to validate the string representation of an empty CreditCard object. The toString method should return a string that accurately represents the state of an empty object.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty CreditCard object.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the empty CreditCard object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned string matches the expected string representation of an empty CreditCard object.

Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the toString method accurately represents the state of an empty CreditCard object. The expected result is a string that includes 'null' for all fields. This test is significant because it ensures that the toString method can handle empty objects and provides a meaningful representation of their state.
