Based on the provided information, here are some test scenarios for the toString() method of the CreditCard entity:
```
Scenario 1: Verify toString() Output with All Fields Populated
Details:
  TestName: verifyToStringWithAllFieldsPopulated
  Description: This test checks if the toString() method correctly formats all fields of the CreditCard entity when they are populated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CreditCard instance with all fields set to non-null values.
  Act: Call the toString() method on the CreditCard instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned string contains all field names and their corresponding values in the expected format.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the toString() method correctly represents all fields of the CreditCard entity. It's important for debugging and logging purposes to have a complete and accurate string representation of the object.
Scenario 2: Verify toString() Output with Null Fields
Details:
  TestName: verifyToStringWithNullFields
  Description: This test checks how the toString() method handles null values for the CreditCard fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CreditCard instance with some or all fields set to null.
  Act: Call the toString() method on the CreditCard instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned string correctly represents null fields without causing any NullPointerException.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the toString() method gracefully handles null values, which is important for robustness and preventing null-related errors when logging or debugging.
Scenario 3: Verify toString() Output with Empty Strings
Details:
  TestName: verifyToStringWithEmptyStrings
  Description: This test checks how the toString() method handles empty strings for the string fields of the CreditCard entity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CreditCard instance with empty strings for creditCardNumber and creditCardExpDate.
  Act: Call the toString() method on the CreditCard instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned string correctly represents empty strings for these fields.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the toString() method correctly handles empty strings, distinguishing them from null values, which is important for accurate representation of the object's state.
Scenario 4: Verify toString() Output with Special Characters
Details:
  TestName: verifyToStringWithSpecialCharacters
  Description: This test checks if the toString() method correctly handles special characters in the CreditCard fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CreditCard instance with special characters (e.g., quotes, backslashes) in the string fields.
  Act: Call the toString() method on the CreditCard instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned string correctly escapes or handles special characters without breaking the string format.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the toString() method can handle special characters without corrupting the output format, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity in logs or debug output.
Scenario 5: Verify toString() Output Consistency
Details:
  TestName: verifyToStringConsistency
  Description: This test checks if multiple calls to toString() on the same CreditCard instance produce consistent results.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CreditCard instance with some non-null values.
  Act: Call the toString() method multiple times on the same CreditCard instance.
  Assert: Verify that all calls return the exact same string.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the toString() method is consistent in its output for unchanged objects, which is important for reliable debugging and logging.
```
These test scenarios cover various aspects of the toString() method, including normal operation, handling of null and empty values, special character handling, and consistency. They aim to ensure that the method works correctly under different conditions and provides accurate string representations of the CreditCard entity.
