Here are various JUnit test scenarios for the `toString` method in the `CreditCard` class:

```plaintext
Scenario 1: All Fields Are Null
Details:
  TestName: toStringWithAllFieldsNull
  Description: Tests the behavior of the toString method when all fields (creditCardNumber, creditCardType, creditCardExpDate) are null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of CreditCard and set all fields to null.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the test instance.
  Assert: Assert that the result matches the expected string representation with all fields as null.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Ensures that the method correctly formats the string when all input fields are null.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Essential for verifying the resilience of the method against null inputs, common in uninitialized objects.

Scenario 2: Normal Field Values
Details:
  TestName: toStringWithNormalFields
  Description: Tests the toString method with typical, non-null field values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of CreditCard and set each field to a typical value (e.g., valid credit card number, type, and expiration date).
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the test instance.
  Assert: Assert that the result matches the expected string representation with proper values.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Validates that the method outputs the correct string format when all fields are properly initialized.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Important to ensure that the method handles typical input correctly, reflecting common real-world usage.

Scenario 3: Edge Case for Credit Card Number
Details:
  TestName: toStringWithEdgeCaseCrediCardNumber
  Description: Tests the toString method with edge case values for the creditCardNumber field, such as extremely long or special characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of CreditCard and set the creditCardNumber to an unusually long or complex string.
  Act: Invoke the toString method.
  Assert: Assert that the output correctly incorporates this edge case number.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Checks how the method handles unusual but valid input characters in the credit card number.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Critical for ensuring that the method robustly handles edge cases in user input, which might be rare but valid.

Scenario 4: Inconsistent Field Values
Details:
  TestName: toStringWithInconsistentFields
  Description: Tests the toString method when one or more fields have inconsistent or unexpected values, like special characters in the expiration date.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set one or more fields to values that are valid but atypical, such as special characters or non-standard formats for the expDate.
  Act: Invoke the toString method.
  Assert: Verify the string representation handles these values gracefully.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Ensures that the toString output correctly incorporates unconventional but permissible values.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Useful for validating that the method can gracefully handle and accurately represent data that is unorthodox but might still be encountered.
```

These scenarios can help ensure that the `toString` method in the `CreditCard` class is thoroughly tested against a variety of normal and edge cases, guaranteeing that it functions properly across different usage contexts.
