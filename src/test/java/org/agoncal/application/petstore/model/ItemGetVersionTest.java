Scenario 1: Test to validate the getVersion method when version is set to a specific value

Details:  
  TestName: testGetVersionWithSpecificValue
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getVersion method when the version is set to a specific value. The target scenario is to ensure that the getVersion method returns the correct version that was previously set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Item object and set the version to a specific value, for example, 5.
  Act: Invoke the getVersion method on the Item object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned version against the expected version, which is 5 in this case.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getVersion method correctly returns the version that was set. The expected result is 5 because that is the version we set for the Item object. This test is significant as it ensures the correct functionality of the getVersion method, which is crucial for version management in the application.

Scenario 2: Test to validate the getVersion method when version is not set

Details:  
  TestName: testGetVersionWithoutSettingValue
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getVersion method when the version is not set. The target scenario is to ensure that the getVersion method returns the default version value, which is null in this case.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Item object without setting the version.
  Act: Invoke the getVersion method on the Item object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned version against the expected version, which is null in this case.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getVersion method correctly returns the default version value when the version is not set. The expected result is null because the version was not set for the Item object. This test is significant as it ensures that the getVersion method behaves correctly when the version is not set, preventing potential null pointer exceptions.

Scenario 3: Test to validate the getVersion method when version is set to a negative value

Details:  
  TestName: testGetVersionWithNegativeValue
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getVersion method when the version is set to a negative value. The target scenario is to ensure that the getVersion method returns the correct version even when it is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Item object and set the version to a negative value, for example, -5.
  Act: Invoke the getVersion method on the Item object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned version against the expected version, which is -5 in this case.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getVersion method correctly returns the version that was set, even if it is negative. The expected result is -5 because that is the version we set for the Item object. This test is significant as it ensures the correct functionality of the getVersion method under edge cases, which is crucial for robust error handling in the application.
