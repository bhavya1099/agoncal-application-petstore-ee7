Scenario 1: Verify getVersion returns correct version after initialization

Details:
  TestName: verifyVersionAfterInitialization
  Description: This test checks that the getVersion method returns the correct version of the Item object immediately after the object is created and the version is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Item and set the version using setVersion.
  Act: Retrieve the version using getVersion.
  Assert: Assert that the retrieved version matches the set version.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion verifies that the version retrieved by getVersion is the same as the version initially set using setVersion. This confirms the correctness of both the setVersion and getVersion methods.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensuring that the version is correctly managed allows for accurate version control and tracking of item modifications, which is crucial for data consistency and integrity in applications with persistent entities.

Scenario 2: Verify getVersion returns default version on new Item instance

Details:
  TestName: verifyDefaultVersionOnNewItem
  Description: This test checks that the getVersion method returns a default value (assumed zero if not set) when called on a newly instantiated Item object where the version has not been explicitly set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of Item without setting the version.
  Act: Call getVersion on the new Item instance.
  Assert: Assert that the version is the default expected value (e.g., 0).
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion checks that the default state of version is as expected (zero or other predefined value) when not explicitly set.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: This test is significant as it confirms the default behavior of the Item class regarding version management, which helps in understanding the initial state of newly created objects in the system.

Scenario 3: Verify getVersion is consistent across multiple calls

Details:
  TestName: verifyVersionConsistencyAcrossCalls
  Description: This test ensures that multiple calls to getVersion return the same value, assuming no changes are made to the version in between calls.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Item, set a specific version.
  Act: Call getVersion multiple times.
  Assert: Check that all getVersion calls return the same value.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test verifies that the getVersion method provides a consistent return value across multiple invocations, which indicates that the method does not alter the state of the object.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Consistency in returned values is critical for reliability, particularly when versions are used in logic that depends on stability of object state over time (e.g., in caching mechanisms or multi-threaded environments).

Scenario 4: Verify getVersion after modifying the version

Details:
  TestName: verifyVersionAfterModification
  Description: This test checks that the getVersion method reflects updates when the version is changed after the object's initial version is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Item, set an initial version, then update the version to a new value.
  Act: Retrieve the version after modification using getVersion.
  Assert: Assert that the retrieved version matches the new version.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test ensures that getVersion accurately reflects changes to the version field, confirming that updates to the version are committed to the object's state.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: This test is important for ensuring that changes to the version are tracked and recognized, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of version-controlled entities throughout their lifecycle.
