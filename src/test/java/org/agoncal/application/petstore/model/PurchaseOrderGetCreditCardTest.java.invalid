``` 
Scenario 1: Valid Credit Card Retrieval

Details:  
  TestName: retrieveValidCreditCard
  Description: Tests if the getCreditCard method returns a CreditCard object that is initially set in the PurchaseOrder object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create and set a CreditCard instance in a PurchaseOrder instance.
  Act: Retrieve the CreditCard instance using the getCreditCard method.
  Assert: Check if the retrieved CreditCard instance is the same as the one that was set.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion verifies that the CreditCard returned by the getCreditCard method is the same instance that was set.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensures that the method correctly retrieves the credit card information associated with a particular purchase order, which is crucial for processing payments and validations.

Scenario 2: Null Credit Card Retrieval

Details:  
  TestName: retrieveNullCreditCard
  Description: Verify if the getCreditCard method returns null when no CreditCard has been set in the PurchaseOrder.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a PurchaseOrder instance without setting a CreditCard.
  Act: Retrieve the CreditCard using the getCreditCard method.
  Assert: Check that the retrieved CreditCard is null.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion checks that the method returns null when no CreditCard is associated.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Important to verify that the system can handle cases where no credit card information is available, such as when a new PurchaseOrder is created but the payment method isn't decided yet.

Scenario 3: Consistency on Multiple Retrievals

Details:
  TestName: consistencyCheckOnMultipleRetrievals
  Description: Test to confirm that multiple invocations of the getCreditCard method return the same CreditCard instance without inadvertently modifying the PurchaseOrderâ€™s state.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a CreditCard instance in the PurchaseOrder.
  Act: Retrieve the CreditCard multiple times using the getCreditCard method.
  Assert: Compare the CreditCard instances from each retrieval to ensure they are identical.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Ensures that subsequent calls to getCreditCard do not create new instances or alter the state of the original CreditCard object.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Validates the immutability and consistency of the PurchaseOrder's state concerning credit card data across its lifecycle, which is essential for data integrity and thread safety.

Scenario 4: Impact on Other Fields

Details:
  TestName: noImpactOnOtherFieldsWhenRetrievingCreditCard
  Description: Ensure retrieving the credit card does not inadvertently modify other fields of the PurchaseOrder, maintaining data integrity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a full PurchaseOrder with all details set, including a CreditCard. Then, record the initial state of other fields.
  Act: Retrieve the CreditCard using the getCreditCard method.
  Assert: Re-check the other fields to confirm they remain unchanged after the credit card retrieval.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Confirms that calling getCreditCard does not affect other fields of the PurchaseOrder.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Critical for ensuring that data handling related to one field does not unintentionally disrupt other data, which is fundamental for reliable business operations and data management.
