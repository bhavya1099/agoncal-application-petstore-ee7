Scenario 1: Test to validate the getVersion method when version is set to a specific value

Details:  
  TestName: testGetVersionWithSpecificValue
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getVersion method when the version is set to a specific value. The target scenario is to ensure that the getVersion method returns the correct version that was previously set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Item object and set the version to a specific value, for example, 5.
  Act: Invoke the getVersion method on the Item object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned version against the expected version, which is 5 in this case.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getVersion method correctly returns the version that was previously set. The expected result is 5 because that's the value we set for the version. This test is significant in ensuring the getVersion method is working as expected.

Scenario 2: Test to validate the getVersion method when version is not set

Details:  
  TestName: testGetVersionWithoutSettingValue
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getVersion method when the version is not set. The target scenario is to ensure that the getVersion method returns the default value of the version, which is 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Item object without setting the version value.
  Act: Invoke the getVersion method on the Item object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned version against the expected version, which is 0 in this case.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getVersion method correctly returns the default value of the version when it's not set. The expected result is 0 because that's the default value for an int variable in Java. This test is significant in ensuring the getVersion method can handle scenarios when the version is not set.

Scenario 3: Test to validate the getVersion method when version is set to a negative value

Details:  
  TestName: testGetVersionWithNegativeValue
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getVersion method when the version is set to a negative value. The target scenario is to ensure that the getVersion method returns the correct version that was previously set, even if it's a negative value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Item object and set the version to a negative value, for example, -5.
  Act: Invoke the getVersion method on the Item object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned version against the expected version, which is -5 in this case.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getVersion method correctly returns the version that was previously set, even if it's a negative value. The expected result is -5 because that's the value we set for the version. This test is significant in ensuring the getVersion method can handle scenarios when the version is set to a negative value.
