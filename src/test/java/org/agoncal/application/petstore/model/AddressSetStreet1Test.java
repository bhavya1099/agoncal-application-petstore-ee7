Here are the test scenarios for the `setStreet1` method:
**Scenario 1: Setting a valid street address**
Details:
TestName: setValidStreetAddress
Description: Test that setting a valid street address updates the `street1` field correctly.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the class with all fields initialized to null.
Act: Call the `setStreet1` method with a valid street address (e.g. "123 Main St").
Assert: Use `assertEquals` to verify that the `street1` field is updated with the expected value.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the `setStreet1` method correctly updates the `street1` field with a valid street address. This is significant because it ensures that the class can store and retrieve a valid street address, which is a critical piece of information for the application.
**Scenario 2: Setting an empty street address**
Details:
TestName: setEmptyStreetAddress
Description: Test that setting an empty street address updates the `street1` field correctly.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the class with all fields initialized to null.
Act: Call the `setStreet1` method with an empty string ("").
Assert: Use `assertEquals` to verify that the `street1` field is updated with an empty string.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the `setStreet1` method correctly updates the `street1` field with an empty string. This is significant because it ensures that the class can handle empty street addresses, which may be a valid use case.
**Scenario 3: Setting a null street address**
Details:
TestName: setNullStreetAddress
Description: Test that setting a null street address updates the `street1` field correctly.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the class with all fields initialized to null.
Act: Call the `setStreet1` method with a null value.
Assert: Use `assertNull` to verify that the `street1` field is updated with a null value.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the `setStreet1` method correctly updates the `street1` field with a null value. This is significant because it ensures that the class can handle null street addresses, which may be a valid use case.
**Scenario 4: Setting a street address with special characters**
Details:
TestName: setStreetAddressWithSpecialChars
Description: Test that setting a street address with special characters updates the `street1` field correctly.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the class with all fields initialized to null.
Act: Call the `setStreet1` method with a street address containing special characters (e.g. "123 Main St. #2").
Assert: Use `assertEquals` to verify that the `street1` field is updated with the expected value.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the `setStreet1` method correctly updates the `street1` field with a street address containing special characters. This is significant because it ensures that the class can handle street addresses with special characters, which may be a valid use case.
**Scenario 5: Setting a street address that exceeds the maximum length**
Details:
TestName: setStreetAddressExceedingMaxLength
Description: Test that setting a street address that exceeds the maximum length throws an exception.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the class with all fields initialized to null.
Act: Call the `setStreet1` method with a street address that exceeds the maximum length (e.g. a string of 256 characters).
Assert: Use `expectException` to verify that a `ValidationException` is thrown.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the `setStreet1` method throws a `ValidationException` when attempting to set a street address that exceeds the maximum length. This is significant because it ensures that the class enforces data integrity and prevents invalid data from being stored.
