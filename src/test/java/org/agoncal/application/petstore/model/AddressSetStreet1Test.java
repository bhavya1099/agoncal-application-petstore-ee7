"""
  Scenario 1: Test to check if the setStreet1 method sets the street1 value correctly
  Details:
    TestName: testSetStreet1ValueCorrectly
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setStreet1 method correctly sets the value of street1.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string for the street1 value.
    Act: Invoke the setStreet1 method with the created string.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the set value against the expected string.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify if the street1 value is set correctly. This is important to ensure that the user's input is accurately stored.
  Scenario 2: Test to check if the setStreet1 method handles null values correctly
  Details:
    TestName: testSetStreet1WithNullValue
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setStreet1 method can handle null values without throwing an exception.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a null string.
    Act: Invoke the setStreet1 method with the null string.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that no exception was thrown.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify if the setStreet1 method can handle null values. This is significant as it checks the robustness of the method.
  Scenario 3: Test to check if the setStreet1 method handles empty strings correctly
  Details:
    TestName: testSetStreet1WithEmptyString
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setStreet1 method can handle empty strings without throwing an exception.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the setStreet1 method with the empty string.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that no exception was thrown.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify if the setStreet1 method can handle empty strings. This is significant as it checks the robustness of the method.
  Scenario 4: Test to check if the setStreet1 method handles long strings correctly
  Details:
    TestName: testSetStreet1WithLongString
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setStreet1 method can handle long strings without throwing an exception.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a long string.
    Act: Invoke the setStreet1 method with the long string.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that no exception was thrown.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify if the setStreet1 method can handle long strings. This is significant as it checks the robustness of the method.
