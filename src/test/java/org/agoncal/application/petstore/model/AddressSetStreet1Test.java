Here are the test scenarios for the `setStreet1` method:
**Scenario 1: Set valid street1 value**
Details:
  TestName: testSetStreet1ValidValue
  Description: Test setting a valid street1 value using the `setStreet1` method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and a valid string value for street1.
  Act: Invoke the `setStreet1` method with the valid string value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the `street1` field is set to the expected value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the `setStreet1` method correctly sets the `street1` field to the provided value. This is important to ensure that the method functions as expected and sets the field correctly.
**Scenario 2: Set null value for street1**
Details:
  TestName: testSetStreet1NullValue
  Description: Test setting a null value for street1 using the `setStreet1` method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and a null value for street1.
  Act: Invoke the `setStreet1` method with the null value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the `street1` field is set to null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the `setStreet1` method correctly handles null values and sets the `street1` field to null. This is important to ensure that the method can handle null values without throwing exceptions.
**Scenario 3: Set empty string for street1**
Details:
  TestName: testSetStreet1EmptyString
  Description: Test setting an empty string for street1 using the `setStreet1` method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and an empty string value for street1.
  Act: Invoke the `setStreet1` method with the empty string value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the `street1` field is set to the empty string value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the `setStreet1` method correctly handles empty strings and sets the `street1` field to the empty string value. This is important to ensure that the method can handle empty strings without throwing exceptions.
**Scenario 4: Set street1 value with leading and trailing whitespace**
Details:
  TestName: testSetStreet1WithWhitespace
  Description: Test setting a street1 value with leading and trailing whitespace using the `setStreet1` method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and a string value for street1 with leading and trailing whitespace.
  Act: Invoke the `setStreet1` method with the string value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the `street1` field is set to the expected value without the leading and trailing whitespace.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the `setStreet1` method correctly trims the input value and sets the `street1` field to the expected value. This is important to ensure that the method correctly handles input values with whitespace.
**Scenario 5: Set street1 value that exceeds the maximum allowed length**
Details:
  TestName: testSetStreet1ExceedsMaxLength
  Description: Test setting a street1 value that exceeds the maximum allowed length using the `setStreet1` method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and a string value for street1 that exceeds the maximum allowed length.
  Act: Invoke the `setStreet1` method with the string value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the `setStreet1` method throws an exception or sets the `street1` field to a truncated value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the `setStreet1` method correctly handles input values that exceed the maximum allowed length and either throws an exception or truncates the value. This is important to ensure that the method correctly handles input values that exceed the maximum allowed length.
Note that these test scenarios assume that the `setStreet1` method is part of a class that has a `street1` field with a maximum allowed length, and that the method is expected to throw an exception or truncate the value if the input exceeds the maximum allowed length. If these assumptions are incorrect, additional test scenarios may be necessary.
