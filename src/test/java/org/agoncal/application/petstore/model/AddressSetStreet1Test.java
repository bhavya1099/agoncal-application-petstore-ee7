Scenario 1: Set Valid Street1
Details:
  TestName: setValidStreet1
  Description: Test setting a valid street1 value to verify if the Address entity correctly stores the provided string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class.
  Act: Call setStreet1 with a valid string, e.g., "123 Elm St."
  Assert: Use getStreet1 to retrieve the value and assert that it matches "123 Elm St."
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion checks that the street1 attribute holds the exact value set by setStreet1.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensuring that the setStreet1 method correctly assigns and stores valid street addresses is crucial for maintaining accurate address records in the system.
Scenario 2: Set Street1 as Null
Details:
  TestName: setStreet1AsNull
  Description: Test setting the street1 value as null to check how the Address entity handles null values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class.
  Act: Call setStreet1 with null.
  Assert: Use getStreet1 to retrieve the value and assert that it is null.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion verifies that the street1 attribute can handle null values, reflecting the absence of a street address.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: This test is important to ensure that the application can gracefully handle cases where a street address is not provided or is unknown.
Scenario 3: Set Street1 as Empty String
Details:
  TestName: setStreet1AsEmpty
  Description: Test setting the street1 value as an empty string to evaluate how the Address entity handles empty strings.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class.
  Act: Call setStreet1 with an empty string "".
  Assert: Use getStreet1 to retrieve the value and assert that it equals an empty string.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion checks that the street1 attribute correctly stores an empty string without errors.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Validating that empty strings are handled correctly is essential for data integrity and user input validation in the system.
Scenario 4: Set Street1 with Excessive Length
Details:
  TestName: setStreet1WithExcessiveLength
  Description: Test setting the street1 with a string that exceeds typical length limits to ensure the Address entity can handle long strings.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class.
  Act: Call setStreet1 with a very long string (e.g., 300 characters).
  Assert: Use getStreet1 to retrieve the value and assert that it matches the long string provided.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion checks that the street1 attribute can store long strings, which might occur in unusual or edge cases.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: This test is crucial for verifying that the system can handle unusually long address inputs without failing, ensuring robustness in data handling.
Scenario 5: Set Street1 with Special Characters
Details:
  TestName: setStreet1WithSpecialCharacters
  Description: Test setting the street1 with special characters to verify that the Address entity handles such inputs correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class.
  Act: Call setStreet1 with a string containing special characters, e.g., "123 Elm St.!@#"
  Assert: Use getStreet1 to retrieve the value and assert that it includes the special characters.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion checks that the street1 attribute handles strings with special characters effectively.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensuring that special characters are processed correctly is important for accommodating all types of street address inputs, enhancing the flexibility and usability of the address management system.
```
These scenarios provide thorough testing of various aspects of the setStreet1 method in the Address entity, covering standard and edge cases to ensure robustness and reliability in handling street address data.
