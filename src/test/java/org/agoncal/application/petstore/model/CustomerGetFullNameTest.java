```markdown
Scenario 1: Both Names Provided Correctly

Details:
  TestName: testGetFullNameWithValidNames
  Description: This test verifies that the getFullName method correctly concatenates the first name and last name with a space when both names are provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a Customer object and set both firstName and lastName with valid strings.
  Act: Call the getFullName method.
  Assert: Assert that the output matches the concatenation of firstName and lastName separated by a space.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the returned string is a concatenation of firstName and lastName, ensuring the functionality handles normal input correctly.
  Important for verifying if names are properly combined in a typical use-case scenario which reflects on UI or data presentation.

Scenario 2: FirstName Provided and LastName is Null

Details:
  TestName: testGetFullNameWithNullLastName
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the getFullName method when the lastName is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Customer object, set firstName to a valid string and lastName to null.
  Act: Call the getFullName method.
  Assert: Assert that the output matches the firstName followed by a space (since lastName is null).
Validation:
  Validates that the method can handle null values for lastName without throwing exceptions and the result should not include any additional characters for the lastName.
  Critical for ensuring graceful handling of incomplete data.

Scenario 3: FirstName is Null and LastName Provided

Details:
  TestName: testGetFullNameWithNullFirstName
  Description: This test assess the result of the getFullName method when the firstName is null and only the lastName is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set firstName to null and lastName to a valid string in a Customer object.
  Act: Invoke the getFullName method.
  Assert: The result should be a space followed by the lastName.
Validation:
  Checks resilience of the getFullName method to null firstName, ensuring the output maintains correct formatting with incomplete data.
  Aids in verifying that the system can handle and present partial name information adequately.

Scenario 4: Both Names are Null

Details:
  TestName: testGetFullNameWithBothNamesNull
  Description: To determine the output of the getFullName method when both firstName and lastName are set to null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Configure a Customer object where both firstName and lastName are null.
  Act: Execute the getFullName method.
  Assert: The result should be a string containing only a single space.
Validation:
  Confirms that the method produces a predictable and manageable result with null inputs for both names.
  It’s essential for confirming the software can gracefully handle completely anonymous or unspecified user data.

Scenario 5: Both Names are Empty Strings

Details:
  TestName: testGetFullNameWithEmptyStrings
  Description: Check how getFullName handles cases where both firstName and lastName are empty strings.
Execution:
  Arrange: Customer object's firstName and lastName are set to empty strings.
  Act: Run getFullName method.
  Assert: Expect the result to be a single space.
Validation:
  Assert aims to confirm correct spacing in the fullName format even when no actual name data is present.
  Clarifies system response to edge cases where user inputs are technically valid but devoid of content, ensuring no extraneous characters are added.
```
The scenarios described aim to thoroughly verify the functionality of the `getFullName` method under various typical and exceptional data conditions, ensuring robustness and reliability of the method’s implementation.

/*
The failure of the test `testGetFullNameWithNullLastName` in the provided unit test function stems from the behavior of the `getFullName()` method when handling `null` values in the `lastName` field of the `Customer` class. The test is designed to expect an output of "John " (note the space after John), assuming that concatenating a `null` value with a string would result in appending an empty string or space. However, the actual behavior in Java when you concatenate a string (e.g., "John") with `null` is that the `null` will be converted into the string "null", resulting in the output "John null".

Therefore, the assertion in the test:
```java
org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(expectedFullName, actualFullName);
```
fails because `expectedFullName` is "John " but `actualFullName` ends up being "John null". The test expectation does not align with the actual behavior of string concatenation involving `null` values in Java.

To properly handle this test scenario, the `getFullName()` method in the `Customer` class should be adjusted to check if `lastName` is `null` and handle it accordingly, perhaps by substituting a `null` value with an empty string to meet the expected outcome of the test case. Alternatively, the expected result in the test should be changed to match the typical Java behavior of converting `null` to "null" in string concatenations.
@Test
@Category(Categories.invalid.class)
public void testGetFullNameWithNullLastName() {
    Customer customer = new Customer();
    customer.setFirstName("John");
    customer.setLastName(null);
    String expectedFullName = "John ";
    String actualFullName = customer.getFullName();
    org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(expectedFullName, actualFullName);
}
*/
/*
The reason for the failure of the `testGetFullNameWithNullFirstName` unit test is due to how Java handles string concatenation when one of the operands is `null`. In Java, concatenating a `null` with a string results in the string "null" being appended, rather than an empty string. 

In the `testGetFullNameWithNullFirstName` function, `customer.setFirstName(null)` is called, and then an attempt is made to concatenate this `null` first name with a non-null last name "Doe" within the `getFullName` method of the `Customer` class. When the `firstName` is `null`, `firstName + " " + lastName` results in `"null Doe"` instead of `" Doe"`.

The assertion in the test function expects `expectedFullName` to be `" Doe"`. However, due to the `null` first name turning into the string "null" when concatenated, `actualFullName` results in `"null Doe"`. This discrepancy between the expected `" Doe"` and actual `"null Doe"` leads to the failure of the test case with a `ComparisonFailure`.

Moreover, the correct concatenation behavior expected in the test assumes that a `null` value should not contribute to the final string, or it should behave like an empty string. To meet this expectation, the `getFullName` method would need to be adjusted to handle `null` values appropriately, such as by using an empty string in place of `null` or adding checks to explicitly handle `null`.

In summary, the test fails because Java's default string concatenation with `null` results in the string "null" being used instead of behaving like an empty string. The test expects the concatenated output to ignore the `null` value, which is not aligned with the default Java behavior.
@Test
@Category(Categories.invalid.class)
public void testGetFullNameWithNullFirstName() {
    Customer customer = new Customer();
    customer.setFirstName(null);
    customer.setLastName("Doe");
    String expectedFullName = " Doe";
    String actualFullName = customer.getFullName();
    org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(expectedFullName, actualFullName);
}

/*
The reason for the failure of the unit test `testGetFullNameWithBothNamesNull` is due to a mismatch between the expected and actual results when the `firstName` and `lastName` fields of a `Customer` object are set to `null`. 

The `getFullName()` method concatenates `firstName` and `lastName` with a space in between. Since both `firstName` and `lastName` are null, the concatenation results in the string "null null". However, the expected result specified in the test is a single space (" "). This discrepancy between the expected output (" ") and the actual output ("null null") is causing the test to fail. 

Specifically, the method handling null inputs by default converts null `String` values into the literal string "null" when concatenated. Thus, concatenating two null values results in "null null" rather than a blank space. The fix would require modifying either the business logic in `getFullName()` to handle null values appropriately or adjusting the expected outcome in the test to match the current behavior of the method. 

In conclusion, the business logic does not handle null inputs in a way that matches the expectation set in the test, leading to a test failure. To pass the test as currently written, an adjustment in the business logic or in the expected result of the test is needed.
