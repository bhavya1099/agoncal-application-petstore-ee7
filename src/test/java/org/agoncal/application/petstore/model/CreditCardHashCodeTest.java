```plaintext
Scenario 1: Test hashCode with identical credit card details

Details:
    TestName: testHashCodeWithIdenticalCreditCardDetails
    Description: Tests whether the hashCode method returns the same hash code for two CreditCard objects with identical properties.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create two CreditCard objects with the same values assigned to creditCardNumber, creditCardType, and creditCardExpDate.
    Act: Call hashCode on both objects.
    Assert: Assert that the hash codes returned by both objects are equal.
Validation:
    This assertion validates that the hashCode implementation considers all specified fields in generating the hash code, ensuring consistent results for objects with identical data. This is crucial for correct behavior in hash-based collections like HashSet or HashMap.

Scenario 2: Test hashCode with different credit card numbers

Details:
    TestName: testHashCodeWithDifferentCreditCardNumbers
    Description: To ensure hashCode generates different hash codes for CreditCard objects with different creditCardNumber values but same creditCardType and creditCardExpDate.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create two CreditCard objects with different creditCardNumber values but identical creditCardType and creditCardExpDate.
    Act: Calculate the hash code for both objects.
    Assert: Check that the hash codes are different.
Validation:
    Validates the sensitivity of the hashCode method to changes in creditCardNumber. This test reflects the importance of respective field contributions to the hash code in maintaining a good distribution in hash-based data structures.

Scenario 3: Test hashCode with different credit card types

Details:
    TestName: testHashCodeWithDifferentCreditCardTypes
    Description: Checks that the hashCode method returns a different value when CreditCard objects differ only by their creditCardType.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create two CreditCard objects with identical creditCardNumber and creditCardExpDate, but different creditCardType values.
    Act: Calculate the hash code for both objects.
    Assert: Assert the hash codes are not the same.
Validation:
    This confirms that the hashCode computation includes the creditCardType attribute effectively, which is essential for correct bucket distribution in hash-based collections.

Scenario 4: Test hashCode with different expiration dates

Details:
    TestName: testHashCodeWithDifferentExpirationDates
    Description: This test checks for the impact of different expiration dates on the hash code of CreditCard objects, keeping other fields constant.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create two CreditCard objects with the same creditCardNumber and creditCardType, but different creditCardExpDate values.
    Act: Obtain the hash code for both objects.
    Assert: Verify that different hash codes are generated.
Validation:
    Assures that the hashCode method appropriately integrates the creditCardExpDate field, which prevents collisions in hash tables and supports efficient data retrieval and storage mechanisms.

Scenario 5: Test hashCode with all fields different

Details:
    TestName: testHashCodeWithAllFieldsDifferent
    Description: Evaluates the uniqueness of the hash code when all fields (creditCardNumber, creditCardType, creditCardExpDate) are different between two CreditCard objects.
Execution:
    Arrange: Construct two CreditCard objects where each field is set to a unique value compared to the other.
    Act: Generate hash codes for both objects.
    Assert: Confirm that the hash codes are distinct.
Validation:
    This test is vital to ensure complete field utilization in generating hash values, necessary for effective performance in large-scale data systems using hashing mechanisms.
