Based on the provided information and the hashCode() method for the CreditCard entity, here are several test scenarios:
Scenario 1: Consistent Hash Code for Same Credit Card Details
Details:
  TestName: consistentHashCodeForSameDetails
  Description: Verify that the hashCode() method returns the same value for two CreditCard objects with identical details.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two CreditCard objects with the same credit card number, type, and expiration date.
  Act: Calculate the hash code for both objects.
  Assert: Compare the hash codes to ensure they are equal.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the hashCode() method is consistent for objects with the same state, which is crucial for the proper functioning of hash-based collections.
Scenario 2: Different Hash Codes for Different Credit Card Numbers
Details:
  TestName: differentHashCodesForDifferentNumbers
  Description: Confirm that the hashCode() method returns different values for CreditCard objects with different credit card numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two CreditCard objects with different credit card numbers but the same type and expiration date.
  Act: Calculate the hash code for both objects.
  Assert: Verify that the hash codes are not equal.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the credit card number contributes to the hash code calculation, allowing for proper differentiation of CreditCard objects in hash-based collections.
Scenario 3: Different Hash Codes for Different Credit Card Types
Details:
  TestName: differentHashCodesForDifferentTypes
  Description: Verify that the hashCode() method returns different values for CreditCard objects with different credit card types.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two CreditCard objects with the same credit card number and expiration date but different types.
  Act: Calculate the hash code for both objects.
  Assert: Confirm that the hash codes are not equal.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the credit card type contributes to the hash code calculation, allowing for proper differentiation of CreditCard objects with different types.
Scenario 4: Different Hash Codes for Different Expiration Dates
Details:
  TestName: differentHashCodesForDifferentExpDates
  Description: Confirm that the hashCode() method returns different values for CreditCard objects with different expiration dates.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two CreditCard objects with the same credit card number and type but different expiration dates.
  Act: Calculate the hash code for both objects.
  Assert: Verify that the hash codes are not equal.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the expiration date contributes to the hash code calculation, allowing for proper differentiation of CreditCard objects with different expiration dates.
Scenario 5: Consistent Hash Code After Modifying and Restoring State
Details:
  TestName: consistentHashCodeAfterModifyingAndRestoringState
  Description: Verify that the hashCode() method returns the same value after modifying and then restoring the CreditCard object's state.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CreditCard object and store its initial hash code.
  Act: Modify the object's state using setter methods, then restore it to its original state.
  Assert: Compare the new hash code with the initial hash code to ensure they are equal.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the hashCode() method is consistent and depends only on the object's state, not on its history of modifications.
Scenario 6: Hash Code for Null Values
Details:
  TestName: hashCodeForNullValues
  Description: Verify that the hashCode() method handles null values for creditCardNumber, creditCardType, and creditCardExpDate without throwing exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CreditCard object with null values for all fields.
  Act: Calculate the hash code for the object.
  Assert: Verify that no exception is thrown and a hash code is returned.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the hashCode() method is robust and can handle null values without causing runtime errors, which is important for the stability of the application.
