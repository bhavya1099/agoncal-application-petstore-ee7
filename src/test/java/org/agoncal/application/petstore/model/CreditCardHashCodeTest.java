Based on the provided method and class information, here are several JUnit test scenarios for the hashCode() method:
Scenario 1: Verify hashCode() with all fields set
Details:
  TestName: hashCodeWithAllFieldsSet()
  Description: Test the hashCode() method when all fields (creditCardNumber, creditCardType, and creditCardExpDate) are set to non-null values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set all fields to non-null values.
  Act: Call the hashCode() method on the instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned hash code is not zero and is consistent when called multiple times.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the hashCode() method generates a non-zero hash code when all fields are set. It also verifies the consistency of the hash code, which is crucial for the proper functioning of hash-based collections.
Scenario 2: Verify hashCode() with all fields null
Details:
  TestName: hashCodeWithAllFieldsNull()
  Description: Test the hashCode() method when all fields are null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class without setting any field values (all null).
  Act: Call the hashCode() method on the instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned hash code is consistent with Objects.hash(null, null, null).
Validation:
  This test checks if the hashCode() method handles null values correctly. It's important to ensure that the method doesn't throw NullPointerException and returns a consistent hash code for objects with all null fields.
Scenario 3: Verify hashCode() consistency with equal objects
Details:
  TestName: hashCodeConsistencyWithEqualObjects()
  Description: Test that two objects with the same field values produce the same hash code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the class with identical non-null values for all fields.
  Act: Call hashCode() on both instances.
  Assert: Verify that both hash codes are equal.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the hashCode() method adheres to the contract that equal objects must have equal hash codes. This is crucial for the correct behavior of hash-based collections.
Scenario 4: Verify hashCode() with different CreditCardType values
Details:
  TestName: hashCodeWithDifferentCreditCardTypes()
  Description: Test that objects with different CreditCardType values produce different hash codes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the class with identical creditCardNumber and creditCardExpDate, but different creditCardType values.
  Act: Call hashCode() on both instances.
  Assert: Verify that the hash codes are different.
Validation:
  This test checks if the hashCode() method correctly differentiates objects based on the CreditCardType enum value. It's important to ensure that different enum values contribute to producing different hash codes.
Scenario 5: Verify hashCode() with empty strings
Details:
  TestName: hashCodeWithEmptyStrings()
  Description: Test the hashCode() method when string fields are empty but not null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with empty strings for creditCardNumber and creditCardExpDate, and a non-null value for creditCardType.
  Act: Call the hashCode() method on the instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned hash code is not the same as an instance with all null fields.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the hashCode() method treats empty strings differently from null values. It's important to verify that the method distinguishes between null and empty string representations in the hash code calculation.
These scenarios cover various aspects of the hashCode() method, including null handling, consistency, and differentiation based on field values. They help ensure that the method behaves correctly in different situations and adheres to the general contract of hashCode() in Java.
