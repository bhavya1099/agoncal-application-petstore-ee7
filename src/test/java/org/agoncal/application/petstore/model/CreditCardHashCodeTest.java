Scenario 1: Testing hashCode method with valid CreditCard object

Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithValidCreditCard.
  Description: This test aims to check the hashCode method with a valid CreditCard object. The test will verify that the hashCode method returns the correct hash value for a given CreditCard object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid CreditCard object with values assigned to creditCardNumber, creditCardType, and creditCardExpDate.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the created CreditCard object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual hash value with the expected hash value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the hashCode method is working as expected and generating the correct hash value for the given CreditCard object. The test is significant in ensuring the uniqueness of each CreditCard object and its proper functioning in collections that rely on hashing.

Scenario 2: Testing hashCode method with null fields in CreditCard object

Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithNullFields.
  Description: This test aims to check the hashCode method when the CreditCard object has null fields. The test will verify that the hashCode method handles null fields without throwing a NullPointerException.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CreditCard object with null values for creditCardNumber, creditCardType, and creditCardExpDate.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the created CreditCard object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that no exception is thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the hashCode method can handle CreditCard objects with null fields without throwing exceptions. The test is significant in ensuring the robustness of the hashCode method.

Scenario 3: Testing hashCode method with two identical CreditCard objects

Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithIdenticalCreditCards.
  Description: This test aims to check the hashCode method with two identical CreditCard objects. The test will verify that the hashCode method returns the same hash value for two CreditCard objects with the same field values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two identical CreditCard objects with the same values for creditCardNumber, creditCardType, and creditCardExpDate.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both CreditCard objects.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the hash values of both objects, they should be the same.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the hashCode method generates the same hash value for two identical CreditCard objects. The test is significant in ensuring the consistency of the hashCode method.
