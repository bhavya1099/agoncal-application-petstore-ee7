Scenario 1: Basic Retrieval of Item ID

Details:
  TestName: getIdShouldReturnCurrentId
  Description: This test checks whether the getId method correctly retrieves the ID value of an Item instance. It verifies that the getter method returns the exact ID that was set or initialized.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Item and set its ID to a specific value (e.g., 123L).
  Act: Call the getId method to retrieve the ID.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ID matches the expected value (123L).

Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: The assertion checks that the getId method should return the exact ID that was set. This is crucial for accurately identifying items in the system and ensuring that data integrity is maintained.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Ensuring the correct functionality of ID retrieval is fundamental, as IDs are often used in database queries, relationships between entities, and for business logic decisions throughout the application.

Scenario 2: Retrieval of Item ID When ID Is Null

Details:
  TestName: getIdShouldHandleNullId
  Description: This test verifies that the getId method correctly handles scenarios where the Item's ID has not been set (i.e., it is null). It is important to ensure that the method gracefully handles null values without causing errors.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Item without setting the ID (ID remains null).
  Act: Call the getId method to retrieve the ID.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ID is null.

Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: The assertion checks that the getId method returns null when the ID has not been set. This test is important for preventing issues that could arise from assuming that ID is always non-null.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Proper handling of null IDs can prevent errors in parts of the application that interact with Item instances, especially before they are persisted or fully initialized. This scenario ensures robustness and stability in the application's data handling strategies.
