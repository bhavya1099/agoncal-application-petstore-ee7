```
Scenario 1: Test Retrieval of Default ID from a Newly Created Country Entity

Details:
  TestName: getIdFromNewCountry
  Description: Verify that getting the ID from a newly instantiated Country entity returns null, assuming the ID has not been set explicitly since new entities should not have an ID by default.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of Country.
  Act: Retrieve the ID using getId().
  Assert: Assert that the retrieved ID is null.
Validation:
  Ensuring the ID of a newly created Country entity is null is crucial for verifying that the entity has not been persisted or assigned an ID yet. This is important in ORM-based frameworks to ensure that the entity lifecycle is managed correctly.

Scenario 2: Test Retrieval of ID After Setting a Specific Value

Details:
  TestName: getIdAfterSetting
  Description: Confirm that after setting a specific Long value as the ID of a Country entity, the getId method returns this exact value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Country and set the ID to a specific Long value.
  Act: Retrieve the ID using getId().
  Assert: Assert that the retrieved ID matches the set value.
Validation:
  It validates the setId and getId consistency and ensures that the ID value correctly round-trips through set/get methods. This behavior is crucial for the integrity of data handling and ensuring the consistency of the entity across various operations like database storage and retrieval.

Scenario 3: Test ID Consistency in Consecutive Calls

Details:
  TestName: consistentIdOnConsecutiveCalls
  Description: Ensures that consecutive calls to getId without altering the ID in between consistently return the same value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Country and set a known ID.
  Act: Call getId consecutively.
  Assert: Verify that all calls to getId return the same ID.
Validation:
  Consistency in consecutive calls to the getId method confirms the reliability of the getter method, crucial for debugging and reliance within transaction scopes where multiple accesses might occur.

Scenario 4: Test Effect of Setting Null ID

Details:
  TestName: verifyEffectOfNullIdSetting
  Description: Assess the behavior of the getId method after explicitly setting the ID to null to simulate clearing the identifier.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Country instance, set a specific ID, then reset it to null.
  Act: Retrieve the ID after setting to null.
  Assert: Assert that the retrieved ID is null.
Validation:
  This test confirms the functionality of the setId method handling null values appropriately and the robustness of the getId method in effectively reflecting null assignments. It is critical in ORM contexts where IDs might be programmatically reset.

```

These scenarios thoroughly cover the behavior of the `getId` method across typical and edge use cases, ensuring the method's reliability and correct functionality in different situations.
