Scenario 1: Basic Retrieval of Country ID

Details:
  TestName: getIdBasicTest
  Description: This test checks the basic functionality of the getId method to ensure it retrieves the correct ID set for a Country object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Country object and set its ID using setId.
  Act: Retrieve the ID using getId.
  Assert: Verify that the retrieved ID matches the set ID.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion checks that the ID retrieved by getId is the same as the ID that was initially set.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensuring that getId accurately retrieves the correct ID is crucial for any operations or logic that depend on the unique identification of a Country entity.

Scenario 2: Test Retrieval of Null ID

Details:
  TestName: getIdWhenIdIsNullTest
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the getId method when the ID has not been set, ensuring it returns null as expected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Country object without setting its ID.
  Act: Retrieve the ID using getId.
  Assert: Confirm that the retrieved ID is null.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion checks that getId returns null when the ID has not been set, aligning with Java's default behavior for uninitialized object fields.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: It is important to confirm that the method handles unset IDs gracefully, returning null, which can be crucial for avoiding NullPointerExceptions in business logic that processes Country IDs.

Scenario 3: Consistency Test for Multiple Calls to getId

Details:
  TestName: getIdConsistencyCheck
  Description: This test ensures that multiple calls to getId on the same object return consistent results, verifying the method's reliability.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Country object and set a specific ID.
  Act: Retrieve the ID multiple times using getId.
  Assert: Check that all retrieved IDs are identical and match the initial set ID.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion verifies that getId provides a consistent result across multiple invocations, indicating that the method is reliable and does not alter the state of the object.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensuring consistency across method calls is essential for stability and predictability in applications that rely on entity identification for processing logic or data retrieval.
```

These scenarios cover basic and edge cases for the `getId` method of the `Country` entity, ensuring the method's functionality is thoroughly validated.
