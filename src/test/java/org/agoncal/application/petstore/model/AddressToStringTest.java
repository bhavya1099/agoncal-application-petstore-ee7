```plaintext
Scenario 1: Complete Address Information Provided
Details:
  TestName: toStringWithFullDetails
  Description: Ensure that the toString method returns a correctly formatted string when all address fields are provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address and set values for street1, street2, city, state, zipcode, and country.
  Act: Call the toString method on the Address instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned string matches the expected format with all provided details.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion checks the complete representation of the address fields in the string, ensuring that all parts are concatenated correctly. This test is significant as it confirms that the Address entity can represent its state fully and accurately in a string format, which is useful for logging or displaying address information.
Scenario 2: Address with Missing Optional Fields
Details:
  TestName: toStringWithMissingOptionalDetails
  Description: Test the toString method to ensure it handles optional fields (like street2) being null gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address, set required fields (street1, city, state, zipcode, country) and leave street2 as null.
  Act: Call the toString method on the Address instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned string correctly formats the address without the street2 field.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion verifies the correct formatting of the string when optional fields are missing. This test is important to ensure that the Address entity's string representation is robust and handles missing data without errors, which is crucial for maintaining application stability when incomplete data is encountered.
Scenario 3: Address with Null Values in Mandatory Fields
Details:
  TestName: toStringWithNullMandatoryDetails
  Description: Test the toString method to check its behavior when mandatory fields (like city or zipcode) are null, which should typically not happen given the entity constraints.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address with street1 set, but leave city and zipcode as null.
  Act: Call the toString method on the Address instance.
  Assert: Check if the method handles or reports null values in mandatory fields appropriately.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion aims to verify how the toString method deals with null values in critical fields. This test is crucial for identifying potential areas where the application might break due to unexpected null values, helping in robustness and error handling.
Scenario 4: Address with Non-String Type Fields
Details:
  TestName: toStringWithNonStringCountry
  Description: Ensure that the toString method correctly incorporates non-string type fields like country (assuming country is an object with its own toString method).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address and set all fields including a mock or dummy Country object with a custom toString implementation.
  Act: Call the toString method on the Address instance.
  Assert: Verify that the country's toString method is called and its output is correctly included in the Address's toString output.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion checks whether Address's toString method integrates non-string field outputs properly into the final string. This test is significant as it ensures that complex objects within Address are represented correctly, which is vital for accurate data representation and debugging.
