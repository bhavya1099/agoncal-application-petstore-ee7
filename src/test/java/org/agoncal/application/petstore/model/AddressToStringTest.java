Based on the provided information, here are several test scenarios for the toString() method of the Address class:
Scenario 1: All Fields Populated
Details:
  TestName: allFieldsPopulated
  Description: Verify that the toString() method correctly formats all fields when they are populated with valid data.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object with all fields populated.
  Act: Call the toString() method on the Address object.
  Assert: Compare the returned string with the expected formatted string containing all field values.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the toString() method correctly includes all fields in the output string when they are populated. It's crucial for debugging and logging purposes to have a complete representation of the object.
Scenario 2: All Fields Null Except Country
Details:
  TestName: allFieldsNullExceptCountry
  Description: Check the toString() output when all String fields are null and only the Country object is instantiated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object with all String fields set to null and a new Country object.
  Act: Invoke the toString() method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned string contains null values for all String fields and a non-null representation for the Country object.
Validation:
  This test verifies the handling of null values in the toString() method, ensuring that null fields are properly represented and that the non-null Country object is included.
Scenario 3: Empty Strings for All String Fields
Details:
  TestName: emptyStringsForAllStringFields
  Description: Test the toString() output when all String fields are empty strings and Country is a new object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an Address object with empty strings for all String fields and a new Country object.
  Act: Call the toString() method on the Address object.
  Assert: Check that the returned string contains empty strings for all String fields and a representation of the Country object.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that empty strings are correctly handled and represented in the toString() output, distinguishing them from null values.
Scenario 4: Long String Values
Details:
  TestName: longStringValues
  Description: Verify the toString() method's behavior with very long string values for each field.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object with very long string values (e.g., 1000 characters) for each String field and a new Country object.
  Act: Invoke the toString() method.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned string correctly includes all the long string values without truncation.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the toString() method can handle and correctly represent large string values, which is important for data integrity in logging or debugging scenarios.
Scenario 5: Special Characters in String Fields
Details:
  TestName: specialCharactersInStringFields
  Description: Test the toString() method's handling of special characters in the String fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an Address object with String fields containing special characters (e.g., quotes, newlines, tabs) and a new Country object.
  Act: Call the toString() method.
  Assert: Verify that the returned string correctly escapes or represents the special characters without breaking the string format.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the robustness of the toString() method in handling potentially problematic characters, ensuring that the output remains valid and readable.
Scenario 6: Null Country Object
Details:
  TestName: nullCountryObject
  Description: Examine the toString() output when the Country object is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object with some values for String fields but set the Country object to null.
  Act: Invoke the toString() method.
  Assert: Check that the returned string correctly represents the null Country object.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the toString() method properly handles a null reference for the Country object, which is important for preventing NullPointerExceptions and ensuring consistent output.
These scenarios cover various aspects of the toString() method, including normal cases, edge cases, and potential error conditions, providing a comprehensive test suite for this method.
