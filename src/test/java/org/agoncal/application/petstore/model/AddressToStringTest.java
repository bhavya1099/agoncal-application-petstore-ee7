Here are the test scenarios tailored for the `toString()` method in the `Address` class, based on its properties and the information provided:

### Test Scenario 1: All Fields Are Null
Details:
- TestName: testToStringWithAllFieldsNull
- Description: Validate that the `toString()` method formats the output correctly if all fields (street1, street2, city, state, zipcode) are null, and only the country object is initialized.
- Execution:
  - Arrange: Create an `Address` object with all fields set to null except for the country which is initialized to a new `Country` object.
  - Act: Invoke the `toString()` method on the `Address` object.
  - Assert: Validate that the string output matches the expected format with null placeholders.
- Validation:
  - The assertion verifies that even if all textual fields are empty, the method correctly handles `null` to avoid throwing NullPointerException and formats the string as expected.
  - This test confirms the robustness of the `toString()` implementation under edge conditions, ensuring the service's resilience and data integrity.

### Test Scenario 2: All Fields Are Non-Null
Details:
- TestName: testToStringWithAllFieldsNonNull
- Description: Ensure that the `toString()` method correct formats the output string when all fields have valid non-null values.
- Execution:
  - Arrange: Set all fields of the `Address` object with placeholder data such as "Street 1", "Street 2", etc., and a valid `Country` object.
  - Act: Invoke the `toString()` method on the populated `Address` object.
  - Assert: Verify that the produced string corresponds exactly to the expected structured format including all values.
- Validation:
  - The assertion guarantees that the method integrates all field values into the string output appropriately, providing a complete visual representation of the object's state.
  - This is crucial for debugging and logging scenarios where complete object visualization is needed.

### Test Scenario 3: Some Fields Are Null
Details:
- TestName: testToStringWithSomeFieldsNull
- Description: Test how the `toString()` method handles cases where some fields are null and others have values.
- Execution:
  - Arrange: Configure an `Address` object with a mix of null values (e.g., Street2 and state are null) and non-null values (e.g., Street1, city, zipcode).
  - Act: Call the `toString()` on this partially populated object.
  - Assert: Confirm that the output string correctly represents both the present and absent values without errors.
- Validation:
  - This will validate the methodâ€™s ability to handle partial data without failing, which is representative of typical real-world incomplete data entries.
  - Important for ensuring stability across various operating environments.

### Test Scenario 4: Special Characters in String Fields
Details:
- TestName: testToStringWithSpecialCharacters
- Description: Validate that the `toString()` method properly includes fields with special characters (' quotes, newline, etc.).
- Execution:
  - Arrange: Set fields of `Address` such as street1, city to string values containing special characters.
  - Act: Execute the `toString()` method.
  - Assert: Ensure the special characters are accurately represented and not escaped or altered.
- Validation:
  - Asserts correctness of serialization for data integrity and consistency, particularly when such representations are used in logs or data streams.

### Test Scenario 5: Using Non-Default Country Object in Country Field
Details:
- TestName: testToStringWithNonDefaultCountry
- Description: Check the `toString()` output when `Country` field is set to a specially configured, non-default instance.
- Execution:
  - Arrange: Initialize and set the country field of `Address` to a Country object with specific properties different from default.
  - Act: Call `toString()`.
  - Assert: Assess whether the output string reflects this non-default country object's properties.
- Validation:
  - Ensures the `toString()` method effectively captures and represents complex, user-defined types embedded within the class.
  - Validates that the string representation includes detailed object compositions, which are important for nested or complex models.

These scenarios comprehensively test the behavior of the `toString()` method under various common and edge cases, ensuring its reliability and correctness in different situations.
