Scenario 1: Test to check if the toString() method returns correct string representation of Address object

Details:  
  TestName: testToStringMethod
  Description: This test is meant to check if the toString() method of the Address class returns the correct string representation of an Address object. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set the fields using the provided setter methods.
  Act: Invoke the toString() method on the Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned string against the expected string representation.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the toString() method provides a correct string representation of the Address object. This is important in contexts where we need to print or log the state of an Address object.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the toString() method handles null values gracefully

Details:  
  TestName: testToStringMethodWithNullValues
  Description: This test is meant to check if the toString() method of the Address class handles null values correctly without throwing a NullPointerException. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object without setting any of its fields (they should all be null).
  Act: Invoke the toString() method on the Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that no exception was thrown and that the returned string accurately represents an Address object with all null fields.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the toString() method can handle null values in the Address object's fields. This is important for ensuring the robustness of the Address class.
  
Scenario 3: Test to check if the toString() method returns different string representations for different Address objects

Details:  
  TestName: testToStringMethodWithDifferentAddresses
  Description: This test is meant to check if the toString() method of the Address class returns different string representations for different Address objects. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two different Address objects and set their fields to different values.
  Act: Invoke the toString() method on both Address objects.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned strings are not the same.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the toString() method provides a unique string representation for each unique Address object. This is important for correctly identifying different Address objects when their string representations are printed or logged.
