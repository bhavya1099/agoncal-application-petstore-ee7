Scenario 1: Test to check if toString method returns correct string representation of Address object

Details:  
  TestName: testToStringOnValidAddressObject
  Description: This test is meant to check if the toString method of the Address class returns the correct string representation of an Address object. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Address object and set all fields (street1, street2, city, state, zipcode, country) with some valid data.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on this object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual string returned by the toString method against the expected string.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the toString method correctly forms the string representation of an Address object. This is important as it ensures the readability and correct representation of Address objects when printed or logged.

Scenario 2: Test to check if toString method handles null values in Address object fields

Details:  
  TestName: testToStringOnAddressObjectWithNullFields
  Description: This test is meant to check if the toString method of the Address class handles null values in the Address object's fields. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Address object and do not set any fields (let them be null).
  Act: Invoke the toString method on this object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned string does not contain any null values and instead has the string 'null' for all the null fields.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the toString method correctly handles null fields in the Address object. This is important as it ensures that the application does not crash due to NullPointerException when trying to print or log an Address object with null fields.

Scenario 3: Test to check if toString method returns correct string when Address object has empty strings in its fields

Details:  
  TestName: testToStringOnAddressObjectWithEmptyStringFields
  Description: This test is meant to check if the toString method of the Address class returns the correct string when the Address object has empty strings in its fields. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Address object and set all fields (street1, street2, city, state, zipcode) with empty strings and country with null.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on this object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned string contains empty strings for all the fields and 'null' for the country.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the toString method correctly handles Address objects with empty string fields. This is important as it ensures that the application correctly represents such Address objects when printed or logged.
