```
Scenario 1: Standard address fields are set correctly

Details:
  TestName: verifyToStringWithCompleteAddress
  Description: This test checks whether the toString() method correctly formats the address when all fields are provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create and set all the address fields (street1, street2, city, state, zipcode, country) with valid data.
  Act: Invoke the toString() method.
  Assert: Compare the return value of the toString() method to the expected string format.
Validation:
  Clarify that all fields appear in the correct order and format as specified in the method implementation. This test ensures that the output is consistently predictable and formatted correctly.

Scenario 2: Address fields are partially empty

Details:
  TestName: verifyToStringWithPartialAddress
  Description: Checks the behavior of toString() when some address fields (like street2, state) are null or empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set only street1, city, zipcode, and country leaving street2 and state as null or empty.
  Act: Call the toString() method.
  Assert: Ensure the resulting string correctly formats the present fields while omitting or correctly displaying empty fields.
Validation:
  This verifies that toString() handles null or empty fields without throwing exceptions or formatting errors, crucial for robust output formatting in partial data scenarios.

Scenario 3: Address with non-standard characters in fields

Details:
  TestName: verifyToStringWithSpecialCharacters
  Description: Ensures the toString() handles special characters in address fields, such as accents or symbols.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set address fields with special characters (e.g., street1 as "Nørre Voldgade", city as "München").
  Act: Invoke the toString() method.
  Assert: Check that the output string retains the special characters correctly.
Validation:
  Validates that special characters are preserved in the toString() output, important for internationalization and correct data representation.

Scenario 4: Address with excessively long field values

Details:
  TestName: verifyToStringWithLongFieldValues
  Description: Tests if toString() can handle very long string values in address fields without truncation or errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set address fields to unusually long string values.
  Act: Call the toString() method.
  Assert: Assert that the produced string contains the full values of these fields.
Validation:
  Ensures toString() method's capability to handle large input data, which is crucial for data integrity and preventing loss of information.

Scenario 5: Address is completely empty

Details:
  TestName: verifyToStringWithEmptyAddress
  Description: Tests how toString() behaves when all address fields are null or empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: An Address object is created without setting any fields (all fields null).
  Act: Execute the toString() method.
  Assert: Assess if the resulting string correctly formats an essentially empty address.
Validation:
  This test is significant as it checks the resilience of the toString() method when dealing with empty data, ensuring no unexpected behavior or errors.
```

These scenarios cover a variety of common and edge cases for the toString method, ensuring comprehensive testing of the method's flexibility and reliability in rendering address data as a string.

/*
The failure of the `verifyToStringWithPartialAddress` test in the AddressToStringTest class is due to a mismatch between the expected string and the actual string produced by the `Address.toString()` method for an Address object.

Here are the key points leading to the test failure:

1. **Expected String Construction**: In the test case, the `expected` String is constructed as:
   ```java
   String expected = "Address{street1='456 Oak St', street2='', city='New York', state='', zipcode='67890', country=United States}";
   ```
   This deliberately sets `street2` to an empty string and `state` to an empty string.

2. **Actual String from `Address.toString()` Method**: The actual output from the `toString()` method of the `Address` class shows that when the `street2` field is set to `null`, it remains `null` in the output of the `Address.toString()` method. This is evident in the error message:
   ```java
   expected:<...6 Oak St', street2='[]', city='New York', ...> but was:<...6 Oak St', street2='[null]', city='New York', ...>
   ```

3. **Mismatch Due to `null` Representation**: The core of the issue is the handling of `null` values in the `toString()` implementation. The test case seems to expect that setting `street2` to `null` would result in it being represented as an empty string (`''`). However, the actual behavior of `toString()` is to show `null` values as "`null`" in the resulting string output.

To summarize, the test case failure is due to a discrepancy in expectations around how `null` values are represented in the string output of the `Address.toString()` method. The method correctly shows unassigned or null fields as "`null`", but the test anticipates these would appear as empty strings in the output. Adjusting either the expected outcome in the test or modifying the `toString()` method in `Address` class to convert `null` values to empty strings would resolve the test failure.

The test failure in the `verifyToStringWithSpecialCharacters` method can be diagnosed by examining the error log from the test run. The test attempts to match an expected string against the output of the `toString()` method of an `Address` object. Here's how the issue unfolds:

1. **Failure in Expected vs. Actual Output**: The error provided indicates an `org.junit.ComparisonFailure` with the following detail:

   ```
   expected:<...Voldgade', street2='[', city='München', state=']', zipcode='31415', ...> but was:<...Voldgade', street2='[null', city='München', state='null]', zipcode='31415', ...>
   ```

   This error signifies that the actual output from the `toString()` method includes 'null' values for `street2` and `state` fields, whereas the expected string omits these 'null' references, expecting blank values instead.

2. **Source of the Issue**: The issue stems from the `toString()` method implementation in the `Address` class which includes all fields, even if they are not set (i.e., are `null`).

    ```
    return "Address{" + 
           "street1='" + street1 + '\'' + 
           ", street2='" + street2 + '\'' + 
           ", city='" + city + '\'' + 
           ", state='" + state + '\'' + 
           ", zipcode='" + zipcode + '\'' + 
           ", country=" + country + '}';
    ```

   Since `street2` and `state` in the test case have not been initialized and explicitly set to any value, they default to `null`. The `toString()` method faithfully prints these `null` values.

3. **Solution Insight**: To pass the test, either the expected string in the test should account for these `null` values, or the `toString()` method must be modified to handle `null` appropriately, suppressing 'null' strings or replacing them with empty strings. The action taken largely depends on the intended use case and design decisions of the application.

In summary, the test fails because the output from the `toString()` method reveals `null` for uninitialized fields which were expected to appear as empty in the printed string. This misalignment between the actual method output and the test's expectations is the root cause of the failure.

The unit test `verifyToStringWithLongFieldValues` for the `Address` class is failing due to a mismatch between the expected and the actual results of the `toString` method. Based on the error log provided, here's the breakdown of the problem:

1. **Mismatched Expected vs. Actual Output**:
   - **Expected**: The test expects the state field to be empty and the zipcode field to be a string of 100 'a' characters.
   - **Actual**: The `toString` method output shows the state as `null` and the zipcode as a string containing null characters (represented as ` `).

2. **Issues in Test Code**:
   - The test seems to have improperly crafted the expected string. There's an issue with how strings for `zipcode` and `state` are being handled:
     - **State Issue**: The state field is initialized as `null` (as seen in the output where the state is shown as 'null') and is not set anywhere in the test or the provided constructors.
     - **Zipcode Issue**: Instead of initializing `zipcode` with 'a's as intended (using `new String(new char[100]).replace('\0', 'a')`), it seems that `zipcode` is being incorrectly initialized, resulting in it being set to null characters ` `.
     
3. **Incorrect `expected` String Construction**:
   - The expected string in the test method constructs `zipcode` and other parts of the address incorrectly, mainly focusing on how the 'null' character replacement and string building occur. For example, setting `zipcode` as a replacement from null character to 'a' might not work as expected if initially misconfigured.

4. **Error in Object Construction**:
   - There seems to be an error or oversight in constructing the `Address` object where potentially mishandled string operations or parameter misassignments during the object creation lead to unexpected null values or incorrect string lengths.

Based on the error details, the first action should be to correctly set up and initialize the `Address` object in the test, ensuring that all fields are assigned appropriate non-null and correctly formatted strings. Also, the actual `toString` method must be verified for its accuracy in handling null values and generating strings for each field. These corrections should help align the test output with expected results, resolving the mismatch leading to test failure.

public void verifyToStringWithLongFieldValues() {
    Country italy = new Country("ITA", "Italy", "Italian Republic", "IT", "380");

    String expected = "Address{street1='" + new String(new char[1000]).replace('\0', 'a') + "', street2='" + new String(new char[500]).replace('\0', 'b') + "', city='Rome', state='', zipcode='" + new String(new char[100]).replace('\0', 'a') + "', country=Italy}";

/*
The test `verifyToStringWithEmptyAddress` is failing due to a mismatch between the expected and actual output of the `Address.toString()` method. The failure is clearly indicated by the `org.junit.ComparisonFailure` which provides detailed information on the mismatch:

- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  Address{street1='', street2='', city='', state='', zipcode='', country=null}
  ```

- **Actual Output** received from the method:
  ```
  Address{street1='null', street2='null', city='null', state='null', zipcode='null', country=null}
  ```

The discrepancy arises because the expected string assumes that all uninitialized String fields of the `Address` class (such as `street1`, `street2`, etc.) should be empty strings (`''`), while in actuality these fields are null by default (since primitive types like int can be 0 but objects like Strings are null if not assigned).

When the `Address` is instantiated using the default constructor and not provided with any values, all string fields (street1, street2, city, state, and zipcode) remain null, as their values are not set. Thus, invoking the `toString` method reflects their null state. 

Furthermore, the `country` field, set via `address.setCountry(new Country());`, leads to the output `country=null` because the `toString` method of `Country` class is invoked, which has been overridden to return the name. In this case, if the name isn't set (which it isn't), it defaults to null, hence the `country=null` in the output.

To fix the test, the expected string should either be adjusted to match the actual default values of an uninitialized `Address` object:
```
Address{street1='null', street2='null', city='null', state='null', zipcode='null', country=null}
```
or, the `Address` object should be initialized explicitly with empty strings and an appropriately initialized `Country` before comparing in the test.

public void verifyToStringWithEmptyAddress() {
    Address address = new Address();
    // Assume default constructor handles minimal
    address.setCountry(new Country());
    // setup
    String expected = "Address{street1='', street2='', city='', state='', zipcode='', country=null}";
    assertEquals(expected, address.toString());
