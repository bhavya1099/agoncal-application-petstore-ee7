Based on the provided information and the toString() method for the Address entity, here are some test scenarios:
Scenario 1: Test toString() with all fields populated
Details:
  TestName: toStringWithAllFieldsPopulated
  Description: Verify that the toString() method correctly formats the output when all fields of the Address entity are populated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object with all fields populated.
  Act: Call the toString() method on the Address object.
  Assert: Compare the returned string with the expected formatted string.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the toString() method correctly represents all fields of the Address entity in the expected format. It's important to verify that all fields are included and properly formatted to maintain consistency in string representation across the application.
Scenario 2: Test toString() with null fields
Details:
  TestName: toStringWithNullFields
  Description: Verify that the toString() method handles null fields gracefully without throwing exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object with some fields set to null.
  Act: Call the toString() method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the method executes without throwing exceptions and returns a string with 'null' for the null fields.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the toString() method can handle null values without causing runtime errors. It's crucial for robustness and preventing NullPointerExceptions when dealing with partially populated Address objects.
Scenario 3: Test toString() with empty strings
Details:
  TestName: toStringWithEmptyStrings
  Description: Verify that the toString() method correctly handles empty strings for text fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object with empty strings for text fields (street1, street2, city, state, zipcode).
  Act: Call the toString() method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned string contains empty quotes for the empty string fields.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the toString() method distinguishes between null and empty string values, which is important for accurate representation of the Address object's state.
Scenario 4: Test toString() with special characters
Details:
  TestName: toStringWithSpecialCharacters
  Description: Verify that the toString() method correctly handles special characters in field values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object with special characters (e.g., quotes, backslashes) in text fields.
  Act: Call the toString() method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned string properly escapes or handles special characters without breaking the string format.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the toString() method can handle special characters without corrupting the output format, which is important for maintaining data integrity and preventing potential parsing issues.
Scenario 5: Test toString() with maximum length values
Details:
  TestName: toStringWithMaxLengthValues
  Description: Verify that the toString() method correctly handles maximum length values for fields with size constraints.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object with maximum allowed length values for fields that have @Size annotations.
  Act: Call the toString() method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned string correctly includes the full length of these maximum-length fields.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the toString() method can handle boundary cases for field lengths without truncation or other unexpected behavior, which is important for maintaining data completeness in string representations.
Note: These scenarios focus on the toString() method and its behavior with different input conditions. They do not assume the existence of any getter or setter methods that were not explicitly provided in the given information.
