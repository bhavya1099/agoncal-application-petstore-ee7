ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=toString_bbffdadaa2

Based on the provided information, here are some test scenarios for the toString() method of the Address class:

Scenario 1: Test toString() with all fields populated

Details:
  TestName: allFieldsPopulated
  Description: Verify that the toString() method correctly formats all fields of the Address object when all fields are populated.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set values for all fields using the provided setter methods. Create a Country object for the country field.
  Act: Call the toString() method on the Address object.
  Assert: Compare the returned string with the expected formatted string containing all field values.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the toString() method correctly includes all fields in the output string when they are populated. It verifies that the method is functioning as expected for a fully populated Address object.

Scenario 2: Test toString() with null values

Details:
  TestName: nullValues
  Description: Check how the toString() method handles null values for some or all fields of the Address object.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object without setting any values, leaving all fields as null except for country which is initialized with a new Country object.
  Act: Call the toString() method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned string contains the correct representation of null values for the string fields and an empty Country object for the country field.

Validation:
  This test verifies that the toString() method handles null values appropriately, ensuring that it doesn't throw NullPointerExceptions and represents null values correctly in the output string.

Scenario 3: Test toString() with empty strings

Details:
  TestName: emptyStrings
  Description: Verify the behavior of toString() when all string fields are set to empty strings.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set all string fields to empty strings using the setter methods. Set the country field to a new Country object.
  Act: Call the toString() method on the Address object.
  Assert: Check that the returned string contains empty strings for all string fields and a representation of the Country object.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the toString() method correctly handles and represents empty strings in the output, distinguishing them from null values.

Scenario 4: Test toString() with special characters

Details:
  TestName: specialCharacters
  Description: Verify that the toString() method correctly handles special characters in the field values.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set values containing special characters (e.g., quotes, backslashes) for the string fields using the setter methods. Set the country field to a new Country object.
  Act: Call the toString() method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned string correctly escapes or represents the special characters without breaking the string format.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the toString() method can handle special characters in field values without causing formatting issues or escaping problems in the output string.

Scenario 5: Test toString() with very long field values

Details:
  TestName: longFieldValues
  Description: Check how the toString() method handles very long values for the string fields.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set very long string values (e.g., 1000 characters) for each string field using the setter methods. Set the country field to a new Country object.
  Act: Call the toString() method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned string correctly includes the full length of each field value without truncation.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the toString() method can handle and correctly represent very long field values without truncating or altering the data, which is important for data integrity in string representations.

These scenarios cover various aspects of the toString() method, including normal operation, edge cases with null and empty values, special character handling, and behavior with extreme input lengths. They aim to thoroughly test the method's functionality and robustness.
