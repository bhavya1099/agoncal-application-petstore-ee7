Based on the provided information, here are some test scenarios for the hashCode() method of the Country entity:
Scenario 1: Verify hashCode() returns consistent values for the same isoCode
Details:
  TestName: consistentHashCodeForSameIsoCode
  Description: This test ensures that the hashCode() method returns the same value when called multiple times on a Country object with the same isoCode.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Country object with a specific isoCode.
  Act: Call hashCode() multiple times on the same object.
  Assert: Verify that all calls return the same hash code.
Validation:
  This test validates that the hashCode() method is consistent, which is a fundamental contract of the hashCode() method in Java. Consistency is crucial for the correct functioning of hash-based collections.
Scenario 2: Verify different isoCodes produce different hash codes
Details:
  TestName: differentHashCodesForDifferentIsoCodes
  Description: This test checks if two Country objects with different isoCodes produce different hash codes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Country objects with different isoCodes.
  Act: Call hashCode() on both objects.
  Assert: Verify that the hash codes are different.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the hashCode() method can differentiate between Country objects with different isoCodes, which is important for proper distribution in hash-based collections.
Scenario 3: Verify null isoCode handling
Details:
  TestName: hashCodeWithNullIsoCode
  Description: This test checks how the hashCode() method handles a Country object with a null isoCode.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Country object and set its isoCode to null using the setIsoCode() method.
  Act: Call hashCode() on the object.
  Assert: Verify that the method doesn't throw a NullPointerException.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the hashCode() method gracefully handles null isoCode values, which is important for robustness and preventing unexpected runtime errors.
Scenario 4: Verify hashCode() is consistent with equals() method
Details:
  TestName: hashCodeConsistencyWithEquals
  Description: This test ensures that two Country objects considered equal by the equals() method have the same hash code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Country objects with the same isoCode.
  Act: Call hashCode() on both objects and compare them.
  Assert: Verify that both objects have the same hash code and are considered equal by the equals() method.
Validation:
  This test validates that the hashCode() method adheres to the contract with the equals() method, which is crucial for the correct behavior of hash-based collections.
Scenario 5: Verify hashCode() ignores other properties
Details:
  TestName: hashCodeIgnoresOtherProperties
  Description: This test checks if the hashCode() method only considers the isoCode and ignores other properties of the Country object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Country objects with the same isoCode but different values for other properties (e.g., name, printableName).
  Act: Call hashCode() on both objects.
  Assert: Verify that both objects have the same hash code despite having different values for other properties.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the hashCode() method correctly implements the design decision to base the hash code solely on the isoCode, ignoring other properties of the Country object.
