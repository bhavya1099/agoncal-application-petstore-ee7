```plaintext
Scenario 1: Verify hashCode consistency for the same object

Details:
  TestName: verifyHashCodeConsistencyForSameObject
  Description: Validate that multiple invocations of hashCode on the same object instance yield the same result.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Country class and set its isoCode.
  Act: Call the hashCode method multiple times on the same instance.
  Assert: Assert that all results from the hashCode method are equal.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Ensure that the hashCode method returns a consistent value each time it is called on an unchanged object.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Consistency in hashCode is crucial for its use in collections like HashSet and HashMap.

Scenario 2: Verify hashCode difference for objects with different isoCodes

Details:
  TestName: verifyHashCodeDifferenceForDifferentIsoCodes
  Description: This test checks that two objects with different isoCodes produce different hashCodes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two different Country instances with different isoCodes.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on both instances.
  Assert: Assert that the hashCodes are different.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Confirms that objects with distinct identity fields (isoCode) should have unique hashCodes.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Important for the correct functionality of hash-based collections where objects are stored and retrieved based on hashCode.

Scenario 3: Verify hashCode equality for objects with same isoCode

Details:
  TestName: verifyHashCodeEqualityForSameIsoCode
  Description: Ensuring that two objects having the same isoCode value generate the same hashCode.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Country instances with the same isoCode value.
  Act: Compute the hashCode for both instances.
  Assert: Assert that the computed hashCodes are equal.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Tests the correctness of the hashCode implementation, specifically that identical key fields result in identical hash codes.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Itâ€™s crucial for ensuring that hash-based collections handle object identity properly, leading to correct insertion and retrieval behaviors.

Scenario 4: Validate handling of null isoCode in hashCode calculation

Details:
  TestName: validateHandlingOfNullIsoCodeInHashCode
  Description: Checks how the hashCode method handles a Country object when its isoCode field is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Country instance and do not set an isoCode (leave it null).
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on this instance.
  Assert: Verify that the method completes without throwing an exception.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Ensures that the hashCode method is robust and can handle null isoCode without failing.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Critical for the application's stability, particularly in scenarios where Country objects might not have isoCode initialized yet.
