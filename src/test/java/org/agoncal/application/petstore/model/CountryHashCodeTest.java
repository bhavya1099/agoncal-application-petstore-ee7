Based on the provided method and class information, here are several test scenarios for the `hashCode()` method:
Scenario 1: Verify hashCode for an object with non-null isoCode
Details:
  TestName: hashCodeWithNonNullIsoCode
  Description: This test verifies that the hashCode method returns a consistent hash value for an object with a non-null isoCode.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object of the class and set its isoCode to a non-null value.
  Act: Call the hashCode() method on the object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned hash code is not zero and is consistent when called multiple times.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the hashCode method generates a non-zero, consistent hash value based on the isoCode field. It's important because hashCode should return the same value for the same object state, which is crucial for proper functioning in hash-based collections.
Scenario 2: Verify hashCode for an object with null isoCode
Details:
  TestName: hashCodeWithNullIsoCode
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the hashCode method when the isoCode field is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object of the class without setting the isoCode (leaving it null).
  Act: Call the hashCode() method on the object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned hash code is consistent with Objects.hash(null).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the hashCode method handles null isoCode gracefully. It's important to verify that the method doesn't throw a NullPointerException and returns a consistent value for null input, as per the contract of Object.hashCode().
Scenario 3: Verify hashCode consistency with equals method
Details:
  TestName: hashCodeConsistencyWithEquals
  Description: This test verifies that two objects considered equal by the equals method have the same hash code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two objects of the class with the same isoCode value.
  Act: Call hashCode() on both objects.
  Assert: Verify that both objects return the same hash code.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the hashCode method is consistent with the equals method, which is a fundamental contract in Java. Objects that are equal must have the same hash code for proper functioning in hash-based collections.
Scenario 4: Verify hashCode uniqueness for different isoCodes
Details:
  TestName: hashCodeUniquenessForDifferentIsoCodes
  Description: This test checks if different isoCode values result in different hash codes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple objects of the class with different isoCode values.
  Act: Call hashCode() on each object.
  Assert: Verify that the hash codes are different for each object.
Validation:
  While not strictly required by the hashCode contract, this test helps ensure that the hashCode method provides a good distribution of hash values for different inputs, which is beneficial for performance in hash-based collections.
Scenario 5: Verify hashCode ignores other fields
Details:
  TestName: hashCodeIgnoresOtherFields
  Description: This test verifies that the hashCode method only considers the isoCode field and ignores other fields of the class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two objects with the same isoCode but different values for other fields (id, name, printableName, etc.).
  Act: Call hashCode() on both objects.
  Assert: Verify that both objects return the same hash code despite differences in other fields.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the hashCode method correctly implements the intended behavior of only considering the isoCode field. It's important to verify this to maintain consistency with the equals method and avoid unexpected behavior in hash-based collections.
