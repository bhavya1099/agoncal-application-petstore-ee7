Based on the provided method and class information, here are several test scenarios for the `hashCode()` method:
Scenario 1: Consistent Hash Code for Same ISO Code
Details:
  TestName: consistentHashCodeForSameIsoCode
  Description: Verify that the hashCode method returns the same value for objects with the same ISO code, regardless of other field values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two objects with the same ISO code but different values for other fields.
  Act: Calculate the hash code for both objects.
  Assert: Compare the hash codes and ensure they are equal.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the hashCode method is consistent for objects with the same ISO code, which is crucial for the correct behavior of hash-based collections. It confirms that the method only uses the isoCode field for hash calculation, as implemented.
Scenario 2: Different Hash Codes for Different ISO Codes
Details:
  TestName: differentHashCodesForDifferentIsoCodes
  Description: Ensure that the hashCode method returns different values for objects with different ISO codes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two objects with different ISO codes.
  Act: Calculate the hash code for both objects.
  Assert: Compare the hash codes and ensure they are not equal.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the hashCode method produces distinct hash codes for objects with different ISO codes, which is important for proper distribution in hash-based collections.
Scenario 3: Null ISO Code Handling
Details:
  TestName: nullIsoCodeHandling
  Description: Verify that the hashCode method handles null ISO code without throwing an exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object with a null ISO code.
  Act: Calculate the hash code for the object.
  Assert: Ensure that no NullPointerException is thrown and a valid hash code is returned.
Validation:
  This test checks the robustness of the hashCode method when dealing with null values, ensuring that it gracefully handles such cases without causing runtime errors.
Scenario 4: Consistency with Equals Method
Details:
  TestName: consistencyWithEqualsMethod
  Description: Ensure that two objects considered equal by the equals method have the same hash code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two objects with the same ISO code and ensure they are equal according to the equals method.
  Act: Calculate the hash code for both objects.
  Assert: Verify that both objects have the same hash code.
Validation:
  This test validates the contract between equals and hashCode methods, which is crucial for the correct behavior of hash-based collections. Objects that are equal must have the same hash code.
Scenario 5: Hash Code Invariance
Details:
  TestName: hashCodeInvariance
  Description: Verify that the hash code remains constant for an object, even if non-ISO code fields are modified.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object and calculate its initial hash code.
  Act: Modify non-ISO code fields of the object.
  Assert: Recalculate the hash code and ensure it remains the same as the initial hash code.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the hashCode method is not affected by changes to fields other than isoCode, maintaining consistency with the implementation and ensuring stable behavior in hash-based collections.
These test scenarios cover various aspects of the hashCode method, including consistency, differentiation, null handling, compatibility with equals, and invariance. They aim to ensure the correct and robust implementation of the hashCode method in the context of the given class structure.
