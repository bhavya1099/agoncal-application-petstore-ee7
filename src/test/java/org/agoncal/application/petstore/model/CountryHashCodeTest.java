"""
Scenario 1: Validate HashCode Consistency
TestName: testHashCodeConsistency
Description: This test is meant to check the consistency of the hashCode method. If the same object is called twice in succession, it should return the same integer provided no information used in equals comparisons is modified.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two identical instances of the Country class with the same ISO code.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both instances.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the hash codes of both instances.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the hashCode method is consistent. This is important because the general contract of hashCode requires that if two objects are equal according to the equals(Object) method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result.

Scenario 2: Validate HashCode for Different Objects
TestName: testHashCodeForDifferentObjects
Description: This test is meant to check that two different instances of the Country class will not produce the same hash code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two different instances of the Country class with different ISO codes.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both instances.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the hash codes of both instances, they should not be equal.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the hashCode method produces different results for different objects. This is crucial for the correct operation of hash-based collections such as HashMap, HashSet, and others.

Scenario 3: Validate HashCode for Null ISO Code
TestName: testHashCodeForNullIsoCode
Description: This test is meant to check that the hashCode method handles null ISO codes gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Country class with a null ISO code.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that no NullPointerException is thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the hashCode method can handle null ISO codes, which is important for avoiding unnecessary and unexpected exceptions during runtime.

Scenario 4: Validate HashCode for Empty ISO Code
TestName: testHashCodeForEmptyIsoCode
Description: This test is meant to check that the hashCode method can handle an empty ISO code string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Country class with an empty ISO code.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that no exceptions are thrown and a valid hash code is returned.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the hashCode method can handle empty ISO codes, which is important for avoiding unnecessary and unexpected exceptions during runtime and ensuring the robustness of the application.
