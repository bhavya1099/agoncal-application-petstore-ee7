Scenario 1: Test to Check if getCity Returns the Correct City Name

Details:
  TestName: testGetCityReturnsCorrectCityName.
  Description: This test checks if the method getCity() accurately returns the city name after it has been set using the setCity() method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set the city name using the setCity() method.
  Act: Invoke the getCity() method on the Address instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual city name returned by the getCity() method with the expected city name.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getCity() method correctly retrieves the city name. The expected result is the city name that was previously set using the setCity() method. This test ensures that the getCity() method is functioning as expected.

Scenario 2: Test to Check if getCity Returns Null when the City Name is Not Set

Details:
  TestName: testGetCityReturnsNullWhenCityNameNotSet.
  Description: This test checks if the method getCity() returns null when the city name has not been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class without setting the city name.
  Act: Invoke the getCity() method on the Address instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the return value of the getCity() method is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getCity() method correctly handles the scenario where the city name is not set and returns null. This test ensures that the getCity() method is robust and can handle edge cases.

Scenario 3: Test to Check if getCity Returns the Correct City Name after Multiple setCity Calls

Details:
  TestName: testGetCityReturnsCorrectCityNameAfterMultipleSetCityCalls.
  Description: This test checks if the method getCity() accurately returns the most recently set city name after multiple calls to setCity() method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set the city name multiple times using the setCity() method.
  Act: Invoke the getCity() method on the Address instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual city name returned by the getCity() method with the expected city name.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getCity() method correctly retrieves the most recently set city name, even after multiple calls to the setCity() method. This test ensures that the getCity() method is functioning as expected in more complex scenarios.
