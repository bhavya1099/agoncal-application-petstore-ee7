"""
Scenario 1: Test to check the return value when city value is null
Details:  
  TestName: testGetCityWhenNull.
  Description: This test is meant to check the return value of getCity() method when the city is not set. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class without setting the city.
  Act: Invoke the getCity() method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that getCity() returns null when the city is not set. This is the expected behavior because the initial value of city is null.

Scenario 2: Test to check the return value when city value is set
Details:  
  TestName: testGetCityWhenSet.
  Description: This test is meant to check the return value of getCity() method when the city is set. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set the city.
  Act: Invoke the getCity() method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is equal to the set city.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that getCity() returns the set city. This is the expected behavior because getCity() should return the current value of city.

Scenario 3: Test to check the return value when city value is changed
Details:  
  TestName: testGetCityWhenChanged.
  Description: This test is meant to check the return value of getCity() method when the city is changed after it is set. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class, set the city, and then change the city.
  Act: Invoke the getCity() method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is equal to the changed city.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that getCity() returns the changed city. This is the expected behavior because getCity() should always return the current value of city.
