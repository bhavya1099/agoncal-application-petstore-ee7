Scenario 1: Test to verify the default value of city
  Details:
    TestName: testDefaultCityValue
    Description: This test is meant to check the default value of city when the object of the class is created and no value is set to city.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the object of the class.
    Act: Invoke the getCity() method.
    Assert: Check the returned value is null.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the default value of city is null. This is important to ensure that the class correctly initializes its fields.
Scenario 2: Test to verify the return value of city after setting it
  Details:
    TestName: testCityValueAfterSetting
    Description: This test is meant to check the value of city after it has been set using the setter method.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the object of the class and set the city field.
    Act: Invoke the getCity() method.
    Assert: Check the returned value matches the set value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getCity() method correctly returns the value that was set. This is important to ensure that the getter and setter methods for city are working correctly.
Scenario 3: Test to check the return value of city when it is set to an empty string
  Details:
    TestName: testCityValueWhenEmpty
    Description: This test is meant to check the value of city when it has been set to an empty string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the object of the class and set the city field to an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the getCity() method.
    Assert: Check the returned value is an empty string.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getCity() method correctly returns an empty string when city is set to it. This is important to ensure that the class handles empty strings correctly.
Scenario 4: Test to verify the return value of city when it is set to a non-null value after being null
  Details:
    TestName: testCityValueAfterNull
    Description: This test is meant to check the value of city when it is set to a non-null value after being null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the object of the class, set the city field to null, and then set it to a non-null value.
    Act: Invoke the getCity() method.
    Assert: Check the returned value matches the last set value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getCity() method correctly returns the last set value even when it was previously null. This is important to ensure that the class handles null values correctly.
