"""
  Scenario 1: Test to check if the getCity method returns the correct city name

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetCityReturnsCorrectCityName.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getCity() method correctly returns the city name that was previously set using the setCity() method.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address object and set the city name using setCity().
    Act: Invoke the getCity() method on the created Address object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned city name against the one that was set.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the getCity() method correctly retrieves the city name that was previously set. This is important because it ensures the consistency of the Address object's state.

  Scenario 2: Test to check if the getCity method returns null when no city has been set

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetCityReturnsNullWhenNoCitySet.
    Description: This test checks if the getCity() method returns null when no city has been set using the setCity() method.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address object without setting a city.
    Act: Invoke the getCity() method on the created Address object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the getCity() method correctly handles the case where no city has been set. This is important because it ensures the method can handle edge cases without throwing unexpected exceptions.

  Scenario 3: Test to check if the getCity method returns the correct city name after multiple setCity() calls

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetCityReturnsCorrectCityNameAfterMultipleSetCityCalls.
    Description: This test checks if the getCity() method correctly returns the latest city set using the setCity() method, even after multiple setCity() calls.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address object and set the city multiple times using setCity().
    Act: Invoke the getCity() method on the created Address object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned city name is the same as the last one set.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the getCity() method correctly retrieves the latest city that was set. This is important because it ensures that the Address object's state is updated correctly each time setCity() is called.
