Scenario 1: Test retrieval of city when city is not null

Details:
  TestName: testRetrievalOfCityWhenCityIsNotNull
  Description: Verify that the getCity method returns the correct city value when the city field is not null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the city field of the Address object to a non-null value.
    Act: Call the getCity method on the Address object.
    Assert: Ensure that the returned city value matches the set city value.
  Validation:
    The assertion confirms that the getCity method correctly retrieves the city field value, indicating the proper functioning of basic data retrieval.

Scenario 2: Test retrieval of city when city is null

Details:
  TestName: testRetrievalOfCityWhenCityIsNull
  Description: Validate that the getCity method returns null when the city field is null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the city field of the Address object to null.
    Act: Invoke the getCity method on the Address object.
    Assert: Verify that the returned city value is null.
  Validation:
    This test ensures that the getCity method handles the case of a null city field appropriately by returning null, which is an expected behavior for a nullable field.

Scenario 3: Test retrieval of city with leading and trailing whitespaces

Details:
  TestName: testRetrievalOfCityWithWhitespaces
  Description: Check if the getCity method trims leading and trailing whitespaces from the city field value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assign a city value with leading and trailing whitespaces to the Address object.
    Act: Call the getCity method on the Address object.
    Assert: Validate that the returned city value is trimmed from any leading and trailing whitespaces.
  Validation:
    This scenario ensures that the getCity method handles whitespace trimming, which can be crucial for data consistency and presentation purposes.

Scenario 4: Test retrieval of city with special characters

Details:
  TestName: testRetrievalOfCityWithSpecialCharacters
  Description: Ensure that the getCity method retrieves city values containing special characters accurately.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a city value with special characters in the Address object.
    Act: Execute the getCity method on the Address object.
    Assert: Confirm that the retrieved city value with special characters matches the originally set value.
  Validation:
    Verifying the correct retrieval of city values containing special characters is essential for maintaining data integrity and supporting diverse input scenarios.

Scenario 5: Test retrieval of city with maximum allowed length

Details:
  TestName: testRetrievalOfCityWithMaxAllowedLength
  Description: Validate that the getCity method correctly handles city values at the maximum allowed length.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assign a city value at the maximum allowed length to the Address object.
    Act: Call the getCity method on the Address object.
    Assert: Check that the retrieved city value at the maximum length is returned without truncation.
  Validation:
    This test ensures that the getCity method supports the full range of allowed city lengths, preventing potential data loss or truncation issues.

Scenario 6: Test retrieval of city with empty string

Details:
  TestName: testRetrievalOfCityWithEmptyString
  Description: Verify the behavior of the getCity method when the city field is an empty string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set an empty string as the city value in the Address object.
    Act: Invoke the getCity method on the Address object.
    Assert: Ensure that the returned city value is an empty string.
  Validation:
    Checking the response of the getCity method to an empty string input ensures consistent handling of empty data cases within the application context.
