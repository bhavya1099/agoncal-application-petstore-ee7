```
Scenario 1: Valid City Retrieval

Details:
  TestName: ensureCityIsCorrectlyRetrieved
  Description: Test to check that the `getCity()` method correctly returns the city name that was set using `setCity()`.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set the city name using `setCity("New York")`.
  Act: Invoke the `getCity()` method to retrieve the city name.
  Assert: Assert that the returned city name is "New York".
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the `getCity()` method retrieves the correct city name as set by `setCity()` method. This test ensures that the getter and setter for the city are properly linked and functional, which is critical for accurate data handling in business processes that depend on geographic location.

Scenario 2: Null City Retrieval

Details:
  TestName: ensureGetCityHandlesNull
  Description: Test to ensure that the `getCity()` method returns null when the city has not been initialized or explicitly set to null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class without setting the city.
  Act: Invoke the `getCity()` method to retrieve the city name.
  Assert: Assert that the returned city name is null.
Validation:
  This assertion checks the robustness of the `getCity()` code against null values, ensuring that it handles unset or null city gracefully without causing exceptions. This is important for avoiding runtime errors in larger applications where not all parts of an address might be provided.

Scenario 3: City Name as Empty String

Details:
  TestName: ensureEmptyCityNameIsHandled
  Description: Verify that when the city name is set as an empty string, it is retrieved correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address and set the city name using `setCity("")`.
  Act: Call `getCity()` to fetch the city name.
  Assert: Assert that the returned city name is an empty string.
Validation:
  This assertion validates that the `getCity()` method accurately handles and returns an empty string. Maintaining the integrity of such data is critical as it may impact form validations or data reports where city names are mandatory but may be temporarily unavailable or unentered.

Scenario 4: Changing City Name

Details:
  TestName: ensureCityCanBeChangedSuccessfully
  Description: Test to verify that the city attribute can be successfully changed and correctly retrieved multiple times.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address, set the city initially to "Boston" using `setCity("Boston")`, then change it to "Cambridge" using `setCity("Cambridge")`.
  Act: Retrieve the city name using `getCity()`.
  Assert: Assert that the final city name is "Cambridge".
Validation:
  This test checks that the `getCity()` method accurately reflects updates to the city name, which is essential for situations where address data might change over time, such as during user profile updates or editing shipping details on e-commerce platforms.

Scenario 5: Multiple Instances Consistency Check

Details:
  TestName: verifyCityNameAcrossMultipleInstances
  Description: Ensure that `getCity()` returns the correct city for different instances of the Address class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of Address, set one instance's city to "Miami" and another to "Seattle".
  Act: Retrieve and compare city names from both instances using `getCity()`.
  Assert: Assert that the retrieved city names are "Miami" and "Seattle" respectively.
Validation:
  Testing the method's behavior across multiple instances ensures that class properties like `city` are not incorrectly shared or overwritten due to static or similar incorrect implementation errors. This is particularly relevant in multi-user environments and applications where numerous distinct address entries are managed simultaneously.
