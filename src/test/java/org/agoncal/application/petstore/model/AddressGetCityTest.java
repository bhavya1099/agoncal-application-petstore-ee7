Scenario 1: Test to Check the Return Value of getCity Method

Details:  
  TestName: testGetCityReturnValue
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getCity method. The target scenario is when the getCity method is called, it should return the city name set in the Address object. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set a city name using setCity method.
  Act: Invoke the getCity method on the Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result returned by the getCity method against the expected city name.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getCity method correctly returns the city name set in the Address object. The expected result is the city name we set using the setCity method. This test is significant in ensuring that the getCity method is working as expected and correctly retrieving the city name from the Address object.

Scenario 2: Test to Check getCity Method When City is Not Set

Details:  
  TestName: testGetCityWhenCityIsNotSet
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getCity method when the city is not set in the Address object. The target scenario is when the getCity method is called on an Address object without a city set, it should return null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object without setting a city.
  Act: Invoke the getCity method on the Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the getCity method returns null.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getCity method correctly handles the scenario where no city is set in the Address object. The expected result is null since no city was set. This test is significant in ensuring that the getCity method is robust and can handle scenarios where the city is not set. 

Scenario 3: Test to Check getCity Method After Changing the City

Details:  
  TestName: testGetCityAfterChangingCity
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getCity method after the city in the Address object has been changed. The target scenario is when the getCity method is called after the city has been changed, it should return the new city name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set a city name. Then change the city name using the setCity method.
  Act: Invoke the getCity method on the Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result returned by the getCity method against the expected new city name.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getCity method correctly returns the new city name after it has been changed. The expected result is the new city name. This test is significant in ensuring that the getCity method correctly updates to reflect changes in the Address object's city.
