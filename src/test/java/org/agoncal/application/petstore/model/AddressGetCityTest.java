### Test Scenarios for `getCity` Method in `Address` Entity

#### Scenario 1: Valid City Name
Details:
- TestName: testGetCityWithValidName
- Description: This test checks if the `getCity` method correctly returns the city name when it is properly set.

Execution:
- Arrange: Create an instance of `Address` and set the city using `setCity("New York")`.
- Act: Invoke `getCity()` on the created instance.
- Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned city name is "New York".

Validation:
- This assertion confirms that the `getCity` method retrieves the exact city name that was previously set. It validates the functionality of both `setCity` and `getCity` in maintaining and retrieving accurate information, crucial for address-related operations in the application.

#### Scenario 2: Null City Name
Details:
- TestName: testGetCityWithNull
- Description: Checks the behavior of `getCity` when no city name has been set (i.e., it is null).

Execution:
- Arrange: Create an instance of `Address` without setting the city (default is null).
- Act: Invoke `getCity()` on the created instance.
- Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned city name is `null`.

Validation:
- This test verifies that `getCity` handles `null` values gracefully, returning `null` when no city has been set. This is important for scenarios where address details might be incomplete, ensuring that the application can handle such cases without errors.

#### Scenario 3: Empty City Name
Details:
- TestName: testGetCityWithEmptyString
- Description: Verifies the return value of `getCity` when the city is set to an empty string.

Execution:
- Arrange: Create an instance of `Address` and set the city to an empty string using `setCity("")`.
- Act: Invoke `getCity()` on the created instance.
- Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned city name is an empty string.

Validation:
- Asserting an empty string return value checks that `getCity` accurately reflects even unusual or edge case inputs such as an empty string. This ensures that all string inputs, regardless of content, are handled consistently.

#### Scenario 4: City Name with Special Characters
Details:
- TestName: testGetCityWithSpecialCharacters
- Description: Tests the return value of `getCity` when the city name contains special characters or punctuation marks.

Execution:
- Arrange: Create an instance of `Address` and set the city using `setCity("San Jos�")`.
- Act: Invoke `getCity()` on the created instance.
- Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned city name is "San Jos�".

Validation:
- This test ensures that city names containing special characters are correctly returned by `getCity`. It is crucial for supporting international addresses and names that might include accents and other non-standard characters.

These scenarios collectively ensure that the `getCity` method is robust, handling various typical and edge cases effectively, which is vital for any application dealing with comprehensive address management.
