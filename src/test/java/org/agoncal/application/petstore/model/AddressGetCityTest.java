Scenario 1: Test to Check if getCity Returns the Correct City Name

Details:  
  TestName: testGetCityReturnsCorrectCityName.
  Description: This test checks if the method getCity() accurately returns the city name after it has been set using the setCity() method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set the city name using the setCity() method.
  Act: Invoke the getCity() method on the Address instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual city name returned by the getCity() method with the expected city name.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getCity() method correctly retrieves the city name. The expected result is the city name that was previously set using the setCity() method. This test ensures that the getCity() method is functioning correctly.

Scenario 2: Test to Check getCity Returns Null for Uninitialized City

Details:  
  TestName: testGetCityReturnsNullForUninitializedCity.
  Description: This test checks if the method getCity() returns null when the city has not been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class without setting the city.
  Act: Invoke the getCity() method on the Address instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned city is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getCity() method returns null when the city has not been initialized. The expected result is null. This test ensures that the getCity() method correctly handles cases when the city is not set.

Scenario 3: Test to Check if getCity Returns the City Name After Multiple setCity Calls

Details:  
  TestName: testGetCityReturnsCityNameAfterMultipleSetCityCalls.
  Description: This test checks if the method getCity() returns the latest city name after multiple calls to the setCity() method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set the city name multiple times using the setCity() method.
  Act: Invoke the getCity() method on the Address instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual city name returned by the getCity() method with the expected city name.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getCity() method correctly retrieves the latest city name set by the setCity() method. The expected result is the latest city name. This test ensures that the getCity() method correctly updates the city name after multiple calls to the setCity() method.
