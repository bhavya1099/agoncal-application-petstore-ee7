Scenario 1: Test to Check the Return Value of getCity Method

Details:
  TestName: testGetCityReturnValue
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getCity method. The target scenario is when the city field of the Address object has been set, and we want to retrieve this value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set the city field using the setCity method.
  Act: Invoke the getCity method on the Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result returned by the getCity method against the expected city value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getCity method correctly retrieves the city value that was previously set. The expected result is the city value that was initially set on the Address object. This test is significant as it ensures the getCity method is functioning as expected, which is crucial for retrieving the city information of an Address object.

Scenario 2: Test to Check the Return Value of getCity Method When City is Null

Details:
  TestName: testGetCityWhenCityIsNull
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getCity method when the city field is null. The target scenario is when the city field of the Address object has not been set, and we want to retrieve this value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object without setting the city field.
  Act: Invoke the getCity method on the Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result returned by the getCity method against null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getCity method correctly returns null when the city field has not been set. The expected result is null. This test is significant as it ensures the getCity method handles null values as expected, which is crucial for avoiding NullPointerExceptions in the application.

Scenario 3: Test to Check the Return Value of getCity Method After Updating City

Details:
  TestName: testGetCityAfterCityUpdate
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getCity method after the city field has been updated. The target scenario is when the city field of the Address object has been updated, and we want to retrieve this updated value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set the city field. Update the city field using the setCity method.
  Act: Invoke the getCity method on the Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result returned by the getCity method against the updated city value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getCity method correctly retrieves the updated city value. The expected result is the updated city value. This test is significant as it ensures the getCity method is functioning as expected after updates, which is crucial for maintaining accurate city information in an Address object.
