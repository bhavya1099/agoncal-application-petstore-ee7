Based on the provided information and the method `getCity()`, here are several test scenarios for the Address entity:
```
Scenario 1: Retrieve City Name Successfully
Details:
  TestName: getCityReturnsCorrectValue
  Description: Verify that the getCity method returns the correct city name that was set for the Address object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set a city name using the setCity method.
  Act: Call the getCity method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned city name matches the one that was set.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getCity method correctly retrieves the city name stored in the Address object. It's crucial for maintaining data integrity and ensuring that the stored city information can be accurately accessed.
Scenario 2: Get City When City is Null
Details:
  TestName: getCityReturnsNullWhenNotSet
  Description: Check that the getCity method returns null when no city has been set for the Address object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Address object without setting any city.
  Act: Call the getCity method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the getCity method behaves correctly when no city has been set, returning null instead of throwing an exception or returning an empty string. It's important for handling cases where address information might be incomplete.
Scenario 3: Get City After Updating
Details:
  TestName: getCityReturnsUpdatedValue
  Description: Ensure that the getCity method returns the most recent city name after it has been updated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object, set an initial city, then update it with a new city name.
  Act: Call the getCity method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned city name matches the updated value, not the initial one.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the getCity method always returns the most up-to-date city information, which is crucial for maintaining data consistency, especially in scenarios where address information might be modified.
Scenario 4: Get City with Special Characters
Details:
  TestName: getCityHandlesSpecialCharacters
  Description: Verify that the getCity method correctly handles and returns city names containing special characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set a city name that includes special characters (e.g., "São Paulo" or "Nürnberg").
  Act: Call the getCity method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned city name exactly matches the set value, including all special characters.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getCity method can handle and accurately return city names with non-ASCII characters, which is important for supporting international addresses and maintaining data integrity across different character sets.
Scenario 5: Get City in toString Method
Details:
  TestName: getCityReflectedInToString
  Description: Ensure that the city returned by getCity is correctly reflected in the toString method output.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set a specific city name.
  Act: Call the toString method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned string contains the correct city name as returned by getCity.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the getCity method's output is consistently used throughout the Address class, including in its string representation. It's important for debugging and logging purposes, ensuring that the city information is correctly displayed when the Address object is printed or logged.
```
These scenarios cover various aspects of the `getCity()` method, including normal operation, edge cases, and its interaction with other parts of the Address class. They aim to ensure the method works correctly under different conditions and maintains consistency with other class functionalities.
