Scenario 1: Test to check if the getCity method returns the correct city

Details:
    TestName: testGetCityReturnsCorrectCity.
    Description: This test aims to check if the getCity method returns the correct city name that was previously set.
Execution:
    Arrange: An instance of the Address class is created and the city is set to a known value using the setCity method.
    Act: The getCity method is invoked on the instance of the Address class.
    Assert: The returned value from the getCity method is compared to the known city name using assertEquals.
Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the getCity method correctly returns the city that was set previously. The test is significant as it validates the basic functionality of the getter method getCity in the Address class.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the getCity method returns null when city is not set

Details:
    TestName: testGetCityReturnsNullWhenCityIsNotSet.
    Description: This test aims to check if the getCity method returns null when the city is not set.
Execution:
    Arrange: An instance of the Address class is created without setting the city.
    Act: The getCity method is invoked on the instance of the Address class.
    Assert: The returned value from the getCity method is compared to null using assertNull.
Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the getCity method correctly returns null when the city is not set. This test is significant as it checks the default behavior of the getCity method when no city is set.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the getCity method returns the correct city after the city is updated

Details:
    TestName: testGetCityReturnsUpdatedCity.
    Description: This test aims to check if the getCity method returns the updated city name after the city is updated.
Execution:
    Arrange: An instance of the Address class is created and the city is set to a known value using the setCity method. The city is then updated to a new value.
    Act: The getCity method is invoked on the instance of the Address class.
    Assert: The returned value from the getCity method is compared to the updated city name using assertEquals.
Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the getCity method correctly returns the updated city after the city is updated. This test is significant as it checks the behavior of the getCity method when the city is updated.
