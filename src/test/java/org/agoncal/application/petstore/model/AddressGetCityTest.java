Here are the test scenarios for the `getCity()` method:
**Scenario 1: Get City with Null Value**
Details:
TestName: testGetCityWithNullValue
Description: This test checks that the `getCity()` method returns null when the `city` field is not initialized.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the class with the `city` field set to null.
Act: Call the `getCity()` method on the instance.
Assert: Use `Assert.assertNull` to verify that the returned value is null.
Validation: This test ensures that the method behaves as expected when the `city` field is not initialized, which is a common scenario in Java.
**Scenario 2: Get City with Empty String Value**
Details:
TestName: testGetCityWithEmptyStringValue
Description: This test checks that the `getCity()` method returns an empty string when the `city` field is initialized with an empty string.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the class with the `city` field set to an empty string.
Act: Call the `getCity()` method on the instance.
Assert: Use `Assert.assertEquals` to verify that the returned value is an empty string.
Validation: This test ensures that the method behaves as expected when the `city` field is initialized with an empty string, which is a valid input.
**Scenario 3: Get City with Valid String Value**
Details:
TestName: testGetCityWithValidStringValue
Description: This test checks that the `getCity()` method returns the expected string value when the `city` field is initialized with a valid string.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the class with the `city` field set to a valid string (e.g., "New York").
Act: Call the `getCity()` method on the instance.
Assert: Use `Assert.assertEquals` to verify that the returned value matches the expected string.
Validation: This test ensures that the method behaves as expected when the `city` field is initialized with a valid string, which is a common scenario in Java.
**Scenario 4: Get City with Large String Value**
Details:
TestName: testGetCityWithLargeStringValue
Description: This test checks that the `getCity()` method returns the expected string value when the `city` field is initialized with a large string (e.g., a string with 1000 characters).
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the class with the `city` field set to a large string.
Act: Call the `getCity()` method on the instance.
Assert: Use `Assert.assertEquals` to verify that the returned value matches the expected string.
Validation: This test ensures that the method behaves as expected when the `city` field is initialized with a large string, which is a valid input.
**Scenario 5: Get City after Setting Country**
Details:
TestName: testGetCityAfterSettingCountry
Description: This test checks that the `getCity()` method returns the expected string value after setting the `country` field.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the class with the `city` field set to a valid string and the `country` field set to null.
Act: Set the `country` field to a valid `Country` object.
Act: Call the `getCity()` method on the instance.
Assert: Use `Assert.assertEquals` to verify that the returned value matches the expected string.
Validation: This test ensures that the method behaves as expected after setting the `country` field, which is a related field in the class.
These test scenarios cover various edge cases and error handling for the `getCity()` method, including null and empty string values, valid string values, large string values, and the effect of setting the `country` field.
