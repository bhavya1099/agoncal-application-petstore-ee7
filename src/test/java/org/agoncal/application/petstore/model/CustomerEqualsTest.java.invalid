``` 
Scenario 1: Test equality between two identical Customer objects

Details:
  TestName: testEqualityBetweenIdenticalCustomers
  Description: Verify that when comparing two identical Customer objects, the equals method returns true.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two Customer objects with the same login.
    Act: Call the equals method on one Customer object passing the other as a parameter.
    Assert: Ensure that the result is true.
  Validation:
    This test ensures that the equals method correctly identifies identical Customer objects based on their login field.

Scenario 2: Test equality between two different Customer objects

Details:
  TestName: testInequalityBetweenDifferentCustomers
  Description: Validate that when comparing two different Customer objects, the equals method returns false.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two Customer objects with different logins.
    Act: Invoke the equals method on one Customer object using the other as an argument.
    Assert: Verify that the result is false.
  Validation:
    This scenario confirms that the equals method correctly distinguishes between different Customer objects based on their login field.

Scenario 3: Test equality with a null object

Details:
  TestName: testEqualityWithNullObject
  Description: Check if the equals method returns false when comparing a Customer object with null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Customer object and set another object as null.
    Act: Call the equals method on the Customer object passing null as a parameter.
    Assert: Validate that the result is false.
  Validation:
    This test guarantees that the equals method handles the case where the input object is null appropriately.

Scenario 4: Test equality with objects of different classes

Details:
  TestName: testInequalityWithDifferentClassObject
  Description: Ensure that the equals method returns false when comparing a Customer object with an object of a different class.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Customer object and another object of a different class.
    Act: Invoke the equals method on the Customer object with the object of a different class.
    Assert: Confirm that the result is false.
  Validation:
    This scenario confirms that the equals method correctly handles comparisons with objects of different classes.

Scenario 5: Test equality with a Customer and a different entity object

Details:
  TestName: testInequalityWithDifferentEntityObject
  Description: Verify that the equals method returns false when comparing a Customer object with a different entity object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Customer object and another entity object.
    Act: Call the equals method on the Customer object using the different entity object as a parameter.
    Assert: Ensure that the result is false.
  Validation:
    This test ensures that the equals method correctly distinguishes between Customer objects and objects of other entity types.

Scenario 6: Test equality when two Customer objects have different logins

Details:
  TestName: testInequalityWithDifferentLogins
  Description: Check if the equals method returns false when comparing Customer objects with different logins.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two Customer objects with different logins.
    Act: Invoke the equals method on one Customer object passing the other with a different login.
    Assert: Validate that the result is false.
  Validation:
    This scenario validates that the equals method accurately identifies differences in logins between Customer objects.
