Scenario 1: Test equality for two identical Customer objects
Details:
  TestName: testEqualityForIdenticalCustomers
  Description: This test verifies that the equals method correctly identifies two Customer objects as equal when they have the same login.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Customer objects with the same login value.
  Act: Call the equals method on the first Customer object, passing in the second Customer object.
  Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation:
  This assertion confirms that the equals method correctly identifies objects as equal based on the login attribute. The expected result is significant as it ensures that Customer instances with the same login are treated as identical in contexts where object equality is necessary, such as in sets or maps.

Scenario 2: Test equality with null object
Details:
  TestName: testEqualityWithNull
  Description: Verify that the equals method returns false when comparing a Customer object with null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Customer object and set a login value.
  Act: Call the equals method on the Customer object, passing in null.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the equals method is null-safe, returning false when comparing against null. It's crucial for preventing null pointer exceptions in runtime.

Scenario 3: Test equality with different class object
Details:
  TestName: testEqualityWithDifferentClass
  Description: This test checks that the equals method returns false when comparing a Customer object with an object of a different class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Customer object and an instance of a different class.
  Act: Call the equals method on the Customer object, passing the different class instance.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  The assertion tests that the equals method can distinguish between objects of different types. This is vital for maintaining logical consistency in equality checks, especially in collections or when objects of various types might be compared.

Scenario 4: Test inequality for Customers with different logins
Details:
  TestName: testInequalityForDifferentLogins
  Description: Ensure that the equals method identifies two Customer objects as unequal if they have different logins.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Customer objects with different logins.
  Act: Call the equals method on one Customer object, passing in the other.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  This test checks that the equals method operates correctly by using login as the basis for equality. It validates that the logical distinction based on differing logins is accurately enforced, which is crucial for business contexts where login uniqueness is a system requirement.

Scenario 5: Test equality for the same object instance
Details:
  TestName: testEqualityForSameInstance
  Description: Validate that the equals method returns true when comparing the same instance of a Customer object to itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Customer object.
  Act: Call the equals method on this Customer object, passing the same object.
  Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation:
  This assertion checks for correct handling of the reflexive property of equality in the equals method. Ensuring the object is equal to itself is fundamental for consistent behavior in collections and other equality checks.
