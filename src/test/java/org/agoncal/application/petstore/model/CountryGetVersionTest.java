"""
Scenario 1: Testing getVersion method when version is not set

Details:
  TestName: testGetVersionWhenNotSet
  Description: This test is designed to check the getVersion method when no version number has been set for the country object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Country object without setting the version.
  Act: Invoke the getVersion method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned version is 0, the default value for an uninitialized int.
Validation:
  The getVersion method should return the default value for an uninitialized int, which is 0. This test ensures that the method behaves as expected in the absence of any explicit version setting.

Scenario 2: Testing getVersion method after setting a version

Details:
  TestName: testGetVersionAfterSetting
  Description: This test is designed to check the getVersion method after a version number has been set for the country object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Country object and set the version to a specific number.
  Act: Invoke the getVersion method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned version is the same as the set version.
Validation:
  The getVersion method should return the version number that was explicitly set. This test ensures that the method behaves as expected when the version has been set.

Scenario 3: Testing getVersion method after resetting the version

Details:
  TestName: testGetVersionAfterResetting
  Description: This test is designed to check the getVersion method after the version number has been reset for the country object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Country object, set the version to a specific number, and then reset the version.
  Act: Invoke the getVersion method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned version is 0, the default value for an uninitialized int.
Validation:
  The getVersion method should return the default value for an uninitialized int, which is 0, after the version has been reset. This test ensures that the method behaves as expected when the version has been reset.
