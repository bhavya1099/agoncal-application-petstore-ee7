Scenario 1: Basic retrieval of version number

Details:
  TestName: getVersionBasic
  Description: This test verifies that the getVersion method correctly retrieves the version number of a Country instance when it has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Country and set its version to a known value using setVersion.
  Act: Call the getVersion method on the Country instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned version number matches the value set during the Arrange step.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion checks that getVersion returns the correct version number that was previously set. This confirms the getter's functionality and integrity.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensuring that the version number is correctly retrieved is crucial for version control and entity management within a persistence context.

Scenario 2: Default version number on new Country instance

Details:
  TestName: getVersionOnNewInstance
  Description: This test checks the default behavior of the getVersion method when called on a newly instantiated Country object that has not had its version explicitly set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of Country without setting the version.
  Act: Call the getVersion method on the new Country instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned version number is the default Java int value (0), assuming no constructor or initializer sets a different default.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion verifies that a new Country instance has a default version number of 0, reflecting typical Java behavior for uninitialized int fields.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Itâ€™s important to confirm the default state of new instances for consistent application behavior, especially before any explicit version assignment occurs.

Scenario 3: Version number consistency after multiple retrievals

Details:
  TestName: getVersionConsistencyCheck
  Description: This test ensures that multiple calls to getVersion return consistent results, assuming no changes to the version in between calls.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Country and set its version to a specific value.
  Act: Call the getVersion method multiple times on the same Country instance.
  Assert: Assert that all getVersion calls return the same value and that this value matches the one set during the Arrange step.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test checks for the consistency and reliability of the getVersion method over multiple invocations.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Consistency in method outputs, especially getters, is vital for maintaining stable application states and avoiding side effects during data retrieval.

Scenario 4: Version number immutability after external modifications

Details:
  TestName: getVersionImmutabilityAfterExternalChange
  Description: This test examines if the Country's version number remains unchanged through the getVersion method after attempting to modify it through indirect means (assuming immutability).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Country and set its version. Then attempt to modify the version number using a hypothetical indirect method (this is conceptual as no such method exists in the provided interface).
  Act: Call the getVersion method after the modification attempt.
  Assert: Assert that the version number remains unchanged from the initial set value.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test checks whether the version number is protected from changes not made through the designated setter (setVersion).
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensuring the immutability of critical fields like version numbers through unauthorized paths is crucial for maintaining data integrity and consistency.
