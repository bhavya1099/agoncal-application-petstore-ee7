Scenario 1: Testing getVersion method when version is not set

Details:
  TestName: testGetVersionWhenNotSet
  Description: This test is designed to check the getVersion method when no version number has been set for the country object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Country object without setting the version.
  Act: Call the getVersion method on the newly created Country object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned version is null.
Validation:
  The getVersion method should return null if no version has been set for the Country object. This test is important to ensure that the getVersion method behaves as expected in its default state.

Scenario 2: Testing getVersion method after setting a version

Details:
  TestName: testGetVersionAfterSetting
  Description: This test is designed to check the getVersion method after a version number has been set for the country object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Country object and set a version using the setVersion method.
  Act: Call the getVersion method on the Country object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned version equals the version that was set.
Validation:
  The getVersion method should return the version number that was set using the setVersion method. This test ensures that the getVersion method accurately reflects changes to the Country object's state.

Scenario 3: Testing getVersion method with negative version number

Details:
  TestName: testGetVersionWithNegativeNumber
  Description: This test is designed to check the getVersion method after a negative version number has been set for the country object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Country object and set a negative version using the setVersion method.
  Act: Call the getVersion method on the Country object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned version equals the negative version that was set.
Validation:
  The getVersion method should return the negative version number that was set using the setVersion method. This test ensures that the getVersion method accurately reflects changes to the Country object's state, even when the version number is negative.

Scenario 4: Testing getVersion method with maximum possible version number

Details:
  TestName: testGetVersionWithMaxNumber
  Description: This test is designed to check the getVersion method after the maximum possible version number has been set for the country object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Country object and set the maximum possible version using the setVersion method.
  Act: Call the getVersion method on the Country object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned version equals the maximum version that was set.
Validation:
  The getVersion method should return the maximum version number that was set using the setVersion method. This test ensures that the getVersion method can handle the maximum possible version number.
