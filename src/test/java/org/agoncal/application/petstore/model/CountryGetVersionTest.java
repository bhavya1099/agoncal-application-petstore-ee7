"""
Scenario 1: Testing getVersion method when version is not set

Details:
  TestName: testGetVersionWhenNotSet
  Description: This test is designed to check the getVersion method when no version number has been set for the Country object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Country object without setting the version.
  Act: Call the getVersion method on the Country object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned version is null.
Validation:
  This test aims to verify that the getVersion method correctly returns null when no version has been set. This is expected as the default value of the version field is null in the Country class.

Scenario 2: Testing getVersion method after setting a version

Details:
  TestName: testGetVersionAfterSetting
  Description: This test is designed to check the getVersion method after a version number has been set for the Country object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Country object and set a version using the setVersion method.
  Act: Call the getVersion method on the Country object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned version equals the version that was set.
Validation:
  This test aims to verify that the getVersion method correctly returns the version that was set. This is important to ensure that the version field is being correctly set and retrieved.

Scenario 3: Testing getVersion method with multiple version updates

Details:
  TestName: testGetVersionWithMultipleUpdates
  Description: This test is designed to check the getVersion method after the version number has been updated multiple times.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Country object and set a version using the setVersion method. Update the version multiple times.
  Act: Call the getVersion method on the Country object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned version equals the latest version that was set.
Validation:
  This test aims to verify that the getVersion method correctly returns the latest version after multiple updates. This is important to ensure that the version field is being correctly updated and the latest version is being retrieved.
