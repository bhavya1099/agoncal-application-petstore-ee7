Scenario 1: Basic retrieval of version number

Details:
  TestName: getVersionBasic
  Description: Tests if getVersion correctly returns the version number of a country entry when it has been explicitly assigned.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Country class and set its version using setVersion.
  Act: Obtain the version number by calling the getVersion method.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to ensure that the retrieved version matches the set version.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: This ensures that the getVersion method returns the correct version number that was set.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Essential for confirming that entity version management works, which might be crucial for handling concurrency in database operations.

Scenario 2: Retrieval of version number on new Country instance

Details:
  TestName: getVersionOnNewInstance
  Description: Tests if getVersion returns a correct default value or behaviour when called on a newly instantiated Country object where the version hasn't been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the Country class without setting its version.
  Act: Get the version by calling the getVersion method.
  Assert: Use assertNotNull to ensure that the method call returns a default or initialized value.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: This ensures that the getVersion method provides a valid response even if the setVersion was not previously called.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Validates that the Country instance is robust and can provide consistent output for version, even without prior manipulation.

Scenario 3: Version consistency after multiple set operations

Details:
  TestName: versionConsistencyAfterMultipleSets
  Description: Ensures that subsequent calls to setVersion followed by getVersion consistently return the latest version value set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a Country object and set the version twice to different values.
  Act: Retrieve the version after the last set operation using getVersion.
  Assert: Assert that the returned version matches the last set value.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Verifies that getVersion reflects the most recent version set, showing that the entity updates correctly.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Important for ensuring that entity updates are properly persisted and retrieved, which is essential in situations where the entity might be updated frequently.

Scenario 4: Validate getVersion method invocation without interference

Details:
  TestName: versionRetrievalWithoutInterference
  Description: Confirm that getVersion retrieves the correct value in a typical use scenario without external modifications to the version value during the test execution.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Country instance and set a specific version value.
  Act: Call getVersion to retrieve the version.
  Assert: Confirm that the retrieved version matches the initially set value.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Ensures that getVersion returns an accurate value unrelated to side effects or environmental conditions.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Increases confidence in the getVersion routine's reliability and independence in a controlled environment.
