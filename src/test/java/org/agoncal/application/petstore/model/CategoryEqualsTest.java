Scenario 1: Test Category Object Equality with Itself

Details:  
  TestName: testCategoryObjectEqualityWithItself
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when the object is compared with itself. The target scenario is when the object is being compared with itself, which should return true. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Category object and set name.
  Act: Invoke the equals method using the same object as parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method returns true when an object is compared with itself. This is significant as it confirms the reflexivity of the equals method in accordance with the Java equals contract.

Scenario 2: Test Category Object Equality with Null

Details:  
  TestName: testCategoryObjectEqualityWithNull
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when the object is compared with null. The target scenario is when the object is being compared with null, which should return false. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Category object and set name.
  Act: Invoke the equals method using null as parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method returns false when an object is compared with null. This is significant as it confirms the non-nullity of the equals method in accordance with the Java equals contract.

Scenario 3: Test Category Object Equality with Different Class

Details:  
  TestName: testCategoryObjectEqualityWithDifferentClass
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when the object is compared with an object of a different class. The target scenario is when the object is being compared with an object of a different class, which should return false. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Category object and set name. Also create an object of a different class.
  Act: Invoke the equals method using the object of a different class as parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method returns false when an object is compared with an object of a different class. This is significant as it confirms the type safety of the equals method in accordance with the Java equals contract.

Scenario 4: Test Category Object Equality with Same Name

Details:  
  TestName: testCategoryObjectEqualityWithSameName
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when two Category objects have the same name. The target scenario is when two Category objects have the same name, which should return true. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Category objects and set the same name for both.
  Act: Invoke the equals method using the second Category object as parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method returns true when two Category objects have the same name. This is significant as it confirms the correctness of the equals method implementation in the Category class.

Scenario 5: Test Category Object Equality with Different Name

Details:  
  TestName: testCategoryObjectEqualityWithDifferentName
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when two Category objects have different names. The target scenario is when two Category objects have different names, which should return false. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Category objects and set different names for each.
  Act: Invoke the equals method using the second Category object as parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method returns false when two Category objects have different names. This is significant as it confirms the correctness of the equals method implementation in the Category class.
