```
Scenario 1: Test equality between two identical Category objects

Details:
  TestName: testEqualityBetweenIdenticalObjects
  Description: Verify that when comparing two identical Category objects, the equals method returns true as expected.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two Category objects with the same name.
    Act: Call the equals method on one object passing the other as a parameter.
    Assert: Ensure that the result is true.
  Validation:
    The assertion confirms that the equals method correctly identifies identical Category objects based on their name.

Scenario 2: Test equality between two different Category objects

Details:
  TestName: testEqualityBetweenDifferentObjects
  Description: Confirm that when comparing two different Category objects, the equals method returns false as expected.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two Category objects with different names.
    Act: Invoke the equals method on one object passing the other as a parameter.
    Assert: Verify that the result is false.
  Validation:
    This test validates that the equals method properly distinguishes between different Category objects based on their name.

Scenario 3: Test equality with null object

Details:
  TestName: testEqualityWithNullObject
  Description: Validate the behavior of the equals method when comparing a Category object with null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Category object and set another object reference to null.
    Act: Call the equals method on the Category object passing null as a parameter.
    Assert: Check that the result is false.
  Validation:
    This scenario ensures that the equals method handles the comparison with a null object gracefully and returns false.

Scenario 4: Test equality with a different class object

Details:
  TestName: testEqualityWithDifferentClassObject
  Description: Ensure that the equals method returns false when comparing a Category object with an object of a different class.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Category object and an object of a different class.
    Act: Invoke the equals method on the Category object passing the object of a different class.
    Assert: Validate that the result is false.
  Validation:
    This test confirms that the equals method correctly identifies objects of different classes as unequal.

Scenario 5: Test equality with a Category object having a different name

Details:
  TestName: testEqualityWithDifferentName
  Description: Check that the equals method returns false when comparing two Category objects with different names.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two Category objects with distinct names.
    Act: Call the equals method on one object passing the other as a parameter.
    Assert: Ensure that the result is false.
  Validation:
    This scenario demonstrates that the equals method accurately compares Category objects based on their name.

Scenario 6: Test equality with the same object reference

Details:
  TestName: testEqualityWithSameReference
  Description: Verify that when comparing a Category object with itself, the equals method returns true.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Category object and assign it to another reference.
    Act: Invoke the equals method on the original object passing the reference to itself.
    Assert: Check that the result is true.
  Validation:
    This test ensures that the equals method correctly handles self-comparison and returns true for the same object reference.
