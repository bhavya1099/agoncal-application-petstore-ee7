Scenario 1: Verify Equality of Two Identical Category Objects

Details:
  TestName: compareIdenticalCategories
  Description: This test checks whether the equals method correctly identifies that two Category objects with the same name are equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Category objects with the exact same name field.
  Act: Call the equals method to compare these two Category objects.
  Assert: Assert that the result of equals is true.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that when two Category objects have the same name, they are considered equal by the equals method. This is significant as it underscores the importance of the name field in determining equality in the Category class.

Scenario 2: Verify That Different Category Objects Are Not Equal

Details:
  TestName: compareDifferentCategories
  Description: This test ensures that the equals method correctly identifies two Category objects with different names as unequal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Category objects with different names.
  Act: Call the equals method to compare these two Category objects.
  Assert: Assert that the result of equals is false.
Validation:
  This verifies the functionality of the equals method in discerning Category objects based on differing names, reinforcing that name is the key attribute for equality checking within Category objects.

Scenario 3: Verify Comparison With Null Reference

Details:
  TestName: compareCategoryToNull
  Description: This test verifies that the equals method returns false when comparing a Category object to a null reference.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Category object and set a null reference.
  Act: Call the equals method comparing the Category object with null.
  Assert: Assert that the result of equals is false.
Validation:
  Asserting that the comparison to null returns false confirms that the equals method safely handles null references, avoiding potential NullPointerException.

Scenario 4: Compare Category Object with Object of Different Class

Details:
  TestName: compareCategoryToDifferentClass
  Description: This test checks if the equals method returns false when compared with an object of a different class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Category object and an arbitrary object of a different class such as a String.
  Act: Call the equals method to compare the Category object and the String object.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the equals method can discern classes and is not purely reliant on field values, maintaining type safety by recognising only objects of the Category class as potentially equal.

Scenario 5: Verify Category Equality With Itself

Details:
  TestName: compareCategoryWithItself
  Description: Checks if the equals method correctly identifies that a Category object is equal to itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Category object.
  Act: Call the equals method to compare the Category object with itself.
  Assert: Assert that the result of equals is true.
Validation:
  This test ensures the reflexive property of the equals method in which an object must always be equal to itself, which is critical for consistency in how equality is determined in Java objects.
