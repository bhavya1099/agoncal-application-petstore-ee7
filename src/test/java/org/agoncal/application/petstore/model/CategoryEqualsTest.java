Scenario 1: Comparing two Category objects with the same name
Details:  
  TestName: compareCategoriesWithSameName
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies two Category objects as equal when they have the same name, regardless of other attributes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Category objects with the same name but different descriptions or IDs.
  Act: Use the equals method to compare these two Category objects.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is true.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the equals method is based solely on the 'name' field as per its implementation. This test is significant as it confirms the consistency of the equals method in treating objects with identical names as equal, aligning with business logic that categorizes items based on name uniqueness.
Scenario 2: Comparing Category object with itself
Details:  
  TestName: compareCategoryWithItself
  Description: This test ensures that the equals method identifies a Category object as equal to itself, which is a fundamental property of equivalence relations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a single Category object and assign it to a variable.
  Act: Compare the Category object to itself using the equals method.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is true.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks reflexivity of the equals method. This test is crucial as it confirms that each object must be equal to itself, which is a standard requirement for the implementation of equals in Java.
Scenario 3: Comparing two Category objects with different names
Details:  
  TestName: compareCategoriesWithDifferentNames
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies two Category objects as unequal when they have different names.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Category objects with different names.
  Act: Use the equals method to compare these two Category objects.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the equals method behaves as expected when Category objects have different names. This test is significant as it ensures that the name uniqueness constraint is enforced, which is crucial for business logic that relies on unique category names.
Scenario 4: Comparing Category object with null
Details:  
  TestName: compareCategoryWithNull
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies a comparison with null as false, which is a standard behavior in Java for equals.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Category object and a null reference.
  Act: Compare the Category object with the null reference using the equals method.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the equals method handles null inputs correctly by returning false. This test is important for ensuring robustness and preventing potential NullPointerExceptions in runtime.
Scenario 5: Comparing Category object with an object of a different class
Details:  
  TestName: compareCategoryWithDifferentClassObject
  Description: This test verifies that the equals method returns false when comparing a Category object with an object of a different class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Category object and an object of another class (e.g., String or Integer).
  Act: Compare the Category object with the object of a different class using the equals method.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that the equals method adheres to the principle that objects of different classes cannot be equal. This test is significant for maintaining type safety and correctness in equality checks.
