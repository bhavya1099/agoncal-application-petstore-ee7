Scenario 1: Comparing two Category objects with the same name
Details:
  TestName: compareCategoriesWithSameName
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies two Category objects as equal when they have the same name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Category objects with the same name.
  Act: Invoke the equals method by passing one Category object as a parameter to the equals method of the other Category object.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is true.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion aims to verify the equals method's ability to correctly identify objects as equal based on their names, which is the intended behavior as per the implementation. This test is significant as it validates the core functionality of the equals method, ensuring that it behaves as expected in scenarios where Category objects have the same name.
Scenario 2: Comparing two Category objects with different names
Details:
  TestName: compareCategoriesWithDifferentNames
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies two Category objects as unequal when they have different names.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Category objects with different names.
  Act: Invoke the equals method by passing one Category object as a parameter to the equals method of the other Category object.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion aims to verify the equals method's ability to correctly identify objects as unequal when their names differ. This test is crucial for ensuring the reliability of the equals method in distinguishing Category objects based on their names.
Scenario 3: Comparing a Category object with null
Details:
  TestName: compareCategoryWithNull
  Description: This test verifies that the equals method returns false when comparing a Category object with null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Category object and use null as the second object for comparison.
  Act: Invoke the equals method by passing null to the equals method of the Category object.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion aims to verify the equals method's robustness in handling null values. This test is significant as it ensures that the equals method behaves correctly in scenarios where it is compared against null, preventing potential NullPointerExceptions.
Scenario 4: Comparing a Category object with an object of a different class
Details:
  TestName: compareCategoryWithDifferentClassObject
  Description: This test checks if the equals method returns false when a Category object is compared to an object of a different class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Category object and an object of another class (e.g., String).
  Act: Invoke the equals method by passing the object of a different class to the equals method of the Category object.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion aims to verify the equals method's ability to correctly handle comparisons with objects of different classes. This test is important for ensuring that the equals method does not falsely identify a Category object as equal to an unrelated object, maintaining type safety and integrity of the equal comparisons.
