Scenario 1: Test for equality with the same object
Details:
  TestName: testEqualityWithSameObject
  Description: This test checks if the equals method returns true when comparing the address object to itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object.
  Act: Compare the address object with itself using the equals method.
  Assert: The equals method should return true.
Validation:
  The equals method should return true when comparing an object to itself. This test validates the reflexive property of the equals method.
Scenario 2: Test for equality with a null object
Details:
  TestName: testEqualityWithNull
  Description: This test checks if the equals method returns false when comparing the address object to null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object.
  Act: Compare the address object with null using the equals method.
  Assert: The equals method should return false.
Validation:
  The equals method should return false when comparing an object to null. This test validates the null check in the equals method.
Scenario 3: Test for equality with a different class object
Details:
  TestName: testEqualityWithDifferentClass
  Description: This test checks if the equals method returns false when comparing the address object with an object of a different class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and an object of a different class.
  Act: Compare the address object with the different class object using the equals method.
  Assert: The equals method should return false.
Validation:
  The equals method should return false when comparing an object to an object of a different class. This test validates the class check in the equals method.
Scenario 4: Test for equality with an identical address object
Details:
  TestName: testEqualityWithIdenticalAddress
  Description: This test checks if the equals method returns true when comparing two address objects with identical field values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with identical field values.
  Act: Compare the two address objects using the equals method.
  Assert: The equals method should return true.
Validation:
  The equals method should return true when comparing two objects with identical field values. This test validates the field comparison in the equals method.
Scenario 5: Test for equality with a different address object
Details:
  TestName: testEqualityWithDifferentAddress
  Description: This test checks if the equals method returns false when comparing two address objects with different field values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with different field values.
  Act: Compare the two address objects using the equals method.
  Assert: The equals method should return false.
Validation:
  The equals method should return false when comparing two objects with different field values. This test validates the field comparison in the equals method.
