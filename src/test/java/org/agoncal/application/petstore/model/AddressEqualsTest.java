```
Scenario 1: Objects are the same instance
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithSameInstance
  Description: This test verifies that the equals method returns true when both the left and right operands are the same instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address and assign it to two different references.
  Act: Call the equals method on one of the references, passing the other reference as the argument.
  Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation:
  Clarify that since both references point to the same object, the equals method should recognize them as equal. This confirms the identity check part of the equals method.

Scenario 2: Objects are equal based on properties
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithEqualProperties
  Description: This test checks that the equals method returns true when two different Address instances have the same street1, city, and zipcode.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two different Address instances with the same property values for street1, city, and zipcode.
  Act: Call the equals method on one instance, passing the other instance as the argument.
  Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify with respect to logical equivalence based on relevant properties. This ensures that equals method correctly uses the specified fields (street1, city, zipcode) for equality comparison.

Scenario 3: Objects are not equal due to different street1
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentStreet1
  Description: Evaluate whether the equals method correctly identifies two Address objects as unequal if they differ in the street1 property.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address instances with different street1 values but identical city and zipcode.
  Act: Use equals to compare these two instances.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  Clarifies that the equality check correctly isolates the street1 field as a condition for non-equality. This confirms part of the object property-based equality logic implemented in the equals method.

Scenario 4: Objects are not equal due to different city
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentCity
  Description: Tests whether the equals method identifies two Address objects as unequal when their cities differ, even if other properties are the same.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address instances where only the city field is different.
  Act: Call equals on one object with the other as the argument.
  Assert: Assert that the response is false.
Validation:
  Demonstrates that city is a critical field for determining equality and that the equals method properly considers it in its logic.

Scenario 5: One of the objects is null
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithNull
  Description: Check if the equals method returns false when comparing an Address object with null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address and use null as the second operand for comparison.
  Act: Invoke equals method of the Address instance passing null as the argument.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  Asserts that the method safely handles null inputs by returning false, reflecting proper null safety checks in the method implementation.

Scenario 6: Different class comparison
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentClass
  Description: Verify that the equals method returns false when an Address object is compared with an object of a different class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address and an instance of a different class (e.g., String).
  Act: Call the equals method on the Address instance, passing the different class instance as an argument.
  Assert: Verify that the result is false.
Validation:
  Ensures robust type safety by confirming that the equals method discriminates based on class type, not allowing instances of unrelated classes to be considered equivalent.
