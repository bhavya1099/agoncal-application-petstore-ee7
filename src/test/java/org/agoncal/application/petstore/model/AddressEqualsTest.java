"""
Scenario 1: Test to verify equals method when both objects are the same
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithSameObjects
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when both objects are the same. The target scenario is when the same object is compared with itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object.
  Act: Invoke the equals method with the same object as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion is aiming to verify that the equals method returns true when the same object is compared with itself. This is expected behavior as per the equals method contract.

Scenario 2: Test to verify equals method when the parameter object is null
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithNullObject
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when the parameter object is null. The target scenario is when null is passed as a parameter to the equals method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object.
  Act: Invoke the equals method with null as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion is aiming to verify that the equals method returns false when null is passed as a parameter. This is expected behavior as per the equals method contract.

Scenario 3: Test to verify equals method when objects belong to different classes
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentClassObject
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when the objects belong to different classes. The target scenario is when an object of a different class is passed as a parameter to the equals method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and an object of a different class.
  Act: Invoke the equals method with the object of a different class as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion is aiming to verify that the equals method returns false when an object of a different class is passed as a parameter. This is expected behavior as per the equals method contract.

Scenario 4: Test to verify equals method when objects have different properties
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentProperties
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when the objects have different properties. The target scenario is when an Address object with different properties is passed as a parameter to the equals method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with different properties.
  Act: Invoke the equals method with the second Address object as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion is aiming to verify that the equals method returns false when an Address object with different properties is passed as a parameter. This is expected behavior as per the equals method contract.

Scenario 5: Test to verify equals method when objects have the same properties
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithSameProperties
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when the objects have the same properties. The target scenario is when an Address object with the same properties is passed as a parameter to the equals method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with the same properties.
  Act: Invoke the equals method with the second Address object as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion is aiming to verify that the equals method returns true when an Address object with the same properties is passed as a parameter. This is expected behavior as per the equals method contract.
