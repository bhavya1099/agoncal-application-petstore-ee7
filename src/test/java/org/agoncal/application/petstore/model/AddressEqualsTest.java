### Scenario 1: Address Same Reference Test

Details:
  - TestName: addressSameReferenceTest
  - Description: Checks if the `equals` method returns true when comparing the same instance of an Address object with itself.

Execution:
  - Arrange: Create an instance of Address and use the same reference for comparison.
  - Act: Call the `equals` method using the same instance.
  - Assert: Use JUnit assertion to check that the result is true.

Validation:
  - This test validates identity equivalence in the equals method. If an object is compared with itself, it should always return true, confirming the reflexive property of an equivalence relation. This is significant as it ensures that the basic property of the equals method is respected and correctly implemented.

### Scenario 2: Address Different Reference but Same Data Test

Details:
  - TestName: addressDifferentReferenceSameDataTest
  - Description: Tests if the `equals` method returns true for two different Address instances with identical attribute values.

Execution:
  - Arrange: Create two separate instances of Address with the same values for street1, city, and zipcode.
  - Act: Invoke the `equals` method comparing these two instances.
  - Assert: Assert that the method returns true.

Validation:
  - This test ensures that the equals method is checking for value equality and not just reference equality. It confirms that the equals method is correctly evaluating field values as intended.

### Scenario 3: Address Null Comparison Test

Details:
  - TestName: addressNullComparisonTest
  - Description: Validates that the `equals` method returns false when comparing an Address instance with null.

Execution:
  - Arrange: Create an instance of Address.
  - Act: Compare this instance with null using the equals method.
  - Assert: Assert that the result is false.

Validation:
  - This scenario tests the robustness of the equals method when faced with a null reference. Returning false is expected as per the general contract of the equals method, ensuring reliability and preventing potential NullPointer exceptions.

### Scenario 4: Address Different Classes Comparison Test

Details:
  - TestName: addressDifferentClassesComparisonTest
  - Description: Ensures that the equals method of the Address class returns false when comparing an Address object with an object of a different class.

Execution:
  - Arrange: Create an instance of Address and another class instance (like String).
  - Act: Compare these two instances using the equals method.
  - Assert: Check that the result is false.

Validation:
  - This test validates the logical separation between different types of objects, ensuring that the Address's equals method adheres to the java.lang.Object equals method contract by only returning true for comparisons with instances of the same class.

### Scenario 5: Address Different Field Values Test

Details:
  - TestName: addressDifferentFieldValuesTest
  - Description: Checks if the `equals` method correctly identifies and returns false when any of the critical fields (street1, city, zipcode) differ between two Address instances.

Execution:
  - Arrange: Create two Address instances with differing `street1`, `city`, or `zipcode`.
  - Act: Invoke the `equals` method to compare these two instances.
  - Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check the result is false.

Validation:
  - This scenario ensures the method effectively discerns differences between the critical fields that define the equality of Address objects. It is vital to ensure the method captures true unequal conditions, preventing logical errors in operations involving comparison (like collection operations).
