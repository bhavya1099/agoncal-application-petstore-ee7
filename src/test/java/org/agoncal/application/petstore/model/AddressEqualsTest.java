Scenario 1: Different class comparison

Details:
  TestName: testDifferentClassComparison
  Description: This test ensures that the equals method returns false when an object of a different class is compared with an Address object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and an instance of a different class (e.g., a string).
  Act: Invoke the equals method by passing the object of the different class as a parameter to the Address object's equals method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the result of the equals method is false.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion aims to verify that the Address equals method correctly identifies objects of different types and returns false as they cannot be logically equivalent. This is significant because it ensures type safety in comparisons.

Scenario 2: Comparison with null

Details:
  TestName: testComparisonWithNull
  Description: This test verifies that the equals method returns false when comparing an Address object with null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class.
  Act: Invoke the equals method by passing null as the argument.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the equals method returns false.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion checks the method's ability to handle null inputs safely, returning false, indicating that an Address object is not equivalent to a null reference. This helps prevent NullPointerExceptions in application logic.

Scenario 3: Reflexive comparison

Details:
  TestName: testReflexiveComparison
  Description: This test checks the reflexivity of the equals method, which should return true when an Address object is compared with itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class.
  Act: Invoke the equals method using the same instance as both the caller and the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that the equals result is true.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion tests for reflexivity, a fundamental requirement of the equals contract, ensuring that any non-null reference should be equal to itself.

Scenario 4: Symmetric comparison

Details:
  TestName: testSymmetricComparison
  Description: Tests the symmetric property of the equals method by verifying that two equal object comparisons yield the same result in both directions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two equivalent instances of the Address class with identical properties.
  Act: Compare the first instance to the second, and then the second instance to the first using the equals method.
  Assert: Assert that both comparisons return true.
Validation:
  Clarify the significance of testing the symmetric property of the equals method, which demands that for any non-null references x and y, x.equals(y) must return true if and only if y.equals(x) returns true. This ensures consistency in bidirectional comparisons.

Scenario 5: Inconsistent attributes comparison

Details:
  TestName: testInconsistentAttributesComparison
  Description: This test checks the equals method when two Address instances have differing attributes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the Address class with at least one differing attribute (like different cities).
  Act: Invoke the equals method to compare these two instances.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the equals method returns false.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion checks whether the equals method accurately detects differences in critical attributes, returning false for different instances based on business logic. This ensures reliable entity differentiation based on defined attributes and prevents incorrect data integrity assumptions.
