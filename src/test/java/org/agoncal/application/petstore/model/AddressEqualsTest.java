```
Scenario 1: Test equality for same Address object

Details:
  TestName: testEqualityForSameAddressObject
  Description: Ensures that when comparing an Address object to itself, the equals method returns true.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address object with specific street1, city, and zipcode values.
    Act: Call the equals method on the created Address object passing itself as the argument.
    Assert: Verify that the equals method returns true.
  Validation:
    This test is essential to confirm that the equals method implementation correctly identifies the equality of an object with itself.

Scenario 2: Test equality for different Address object

Details:
  TestName: testEqualityForDifferentAddressObject
  Description: Verifies that when comparing two different Address objects with the same street1, city, and zipcode values, the equals method returns true.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two different Address objects with identical street1, city, and zipcode values.
    Act: Call the equals method on one Address object passing the other Address object as the argument.
    Assert: Ensure that the equals method returns true.
  Validation:
    This test is crucial to validate that the equals method correctly identifies equality between distinct Address objects with matching attributes.

Scenario 3: Test inequality for different Address objects

Details:
  TestName: testInequalityForDifferentAddressObject
  Description: Validates that when comparing two different Address objects with differing street1, city, or zipcode values, the equals method returns false.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two different Address objects with varying street1, city, or zipcode values.
    Act: Invoke the equals method on one Address object passing the other Address object as the argument.
    Assert: Confirm that the equals method returns false.
  Validation:
    This test is necessary to ensure that the equals method correctly identifies inequality between Address objects with different attributes.

Scenario 4: Test equality with null object

Details:
  TestName: testEqualityWithNullObject
  Description: Checks if comparing an Address object to null results in false.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address object with specific street1, city, and zipcode values.
    Act: Call the equals method on the Address object passing null as the argument.
    Assert: Verify that the equals method returns false.
  Validation:
    This test is significant to confirm that the equals method handles null comparison appropriately, returning false when comparing with null.

Scenario 5: Test equality with different class object

Details:
  TestName: testEqualityWithDifferentClassObject
  Description: Verifies that comparing an Address object with an object of a different class results in false.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address object with specific street1, city, and zipcode values.
    Act: Invoke the equals method on the Address object passing an object of a different class as the argument.
    Assert: Ensure that the equals method returns false.
  Validation:
    This test is crucial to ensure that the equals method correctly handles comparisons with objects of different classes, returning false as expected.

Scenario 6: Test equality with a different Address object having null fields

Details:
  TestName: testEqualityWithDifferentAddressNullFields
  Description: Validates that comparing two different Address objects where one has null fields results in false.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two Address objects, one with all fields filled and the other with null fields.
    Act: Call the equals method on one Address object passing the other Address object as the argument.
    Assert: Confirm that the equals method returns false.
  Validation:
    This test is essential to verify that the equals method correctly handles comparisons between Address objects with null fields.
