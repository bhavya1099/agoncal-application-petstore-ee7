"""
Scenario 1: Test to verify equals method when both objects are the same
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithSameObjects
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when both objects are the same. The target scenario is when the same object is compared with itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set the street1, city, zipcode fields.
  Act: Invoke the equals method by passing the same object as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies the same object. The expected result is true because an object is always equal to itself. This test ensures the correct behavior of the equals method in identifying identical objects.

Scenario 2: Test to verify equals method when objects are different
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentObjects
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when the objects are different. The target scenario is when two different objects are compared.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two different Address objects and set different values for the street1, city, zipcode fields.
  Act: Invoke the equals method by passing the second object as a parameter to the equals method of the first object.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies different objects. The expected result is false because the objects have different values for their fields. This test ensures the correct behavior of the equals method in identifying different objects.

Scenario 3: Test to verify equals method when objects have the same field values
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithSameFieldValues
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when two different objects have the same field values. The target scenario is when two objects have the same values for their fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two different Address objects and set the same values for the street1, city, zipcode fields.
  Act: Invoke the equals method by passing the second object as a parameter to the equals method of the first object.
  Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies objects with the same field values. The expected result is true because the objects have the same values for their fields. This test ensures the correct behavior of the equals method in identifying objects with the same field values.

Scenario 4: Test to verify equals method when one object is null
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithNullObject
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when one of the objects is null. The target scenario is when a null object is compared with a non-null object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set the street1, city, zipcode fields.
  Act: Invoke the equals method by passing null as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies a null object. The expected result is false because a non-null object is not equal to null. This test ensures the correct behavior of the equals method when dealing with null values.
