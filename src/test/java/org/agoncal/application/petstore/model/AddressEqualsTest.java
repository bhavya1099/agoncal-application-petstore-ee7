Scenario 1: Address objects equivalence test with identical values
Details:  
    TestName: testAddressObjectsEquivalence
    Description: The test is meant to check the equals method functionality in true scenario where the parameters of two Address objects are identical.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two Address objects with identical city, street1, and zipcode values.
    Act: Invoke the equals method by checking if the first Address object equals the second.
    Assert: Assert true as the result of the equals method because both objects possess identical parameters.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the equals method is capable of accurately determining equivalence between two Address objects. This is significant in ensuring data integrity and correct application behavior.
Scenario 2: Address objects non-equivalence test with different values
Details:  
    TestName: testAddressObjectsNonEquivalence
    Description: The test is meant to evaluate equals method functionality in a scenario where the parameters of two Address objects (city, street1, zipcode) differ.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two Address objects with different city, street1, or zipcode values.
    Act: Invoke the equals method by checking if the first Address object equals the second.
    Assert: Assert false as the result of the equals method due to the differences in parameters.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies the equals method's capability to detect non-equivalence between two differing Address objects. This is crucial in maintaining accurate data representation.
Scenario 3: Address object equivalence with itself
Details:  
    TestName: testAddressObjectSelfEquivalence
    Description: This test is intended to check the equals method conditions when the same Address object instance is compared with itself.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address object.
    Act: Invoke the equals method by checking if the Address object equals itself.
    Assert: Assert true as the result of the equals method given that an object is always equals to itself.
  Validation: 
    Assertion verifies that the equals method adheres to reflexive property i.e., any object should be equal to itself. This is important for maintaining precision in internal object comparisons.
Scenario 4: Address objects non-equivalence with null object
Details:  
   TestName: testAddressObjectNonEquivalenceWithNull
   Description: This test is designed to assess equals method behavior when comparing an Address object with a null reference.
 Execution:
   Arrange: Create an Address object.
   Act: Invoke the equals method by checking if the Address object equals a null reference.
   Assert: Assert false as the result of the equals method since no object equals null reference.
 Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that equals method is able to handle null references correctly without causing null pointer exceptions. This test is significant for improving application resilience.

@Category({Categories.equals.class})
The compilation error faced is usually due to issues in the test code. Considering the provided code, the AddressEqualsTest class AddressEqualsTest fine. All test cases seems to have the correct implementations in accordance with our business logic function which is an override of "equals()" method in "Address" class. Thus, no changes are required in the Junit test cases as they are following the given business logic function.
However, there might be a possibility that the "Address" class AddressEqualsTest "Country" class AddressEqualsTest in the tests have not been imported properly or there are some issues therein, leading to a compilation failure. This error may not be a result of the test cases in the `AddressEqualsTest` file but might be due to some other related issue.
Alternatively, this error can also occur if the maven compiler plugin version is not compatible with the project structure, causing it to fail during the compilation step. In such a scenario, please check the maven compiler plugin version.
In conclusion, since the test cases as provided are correctly implemented, there is no need to modify them. However, please check the other potential issues mentioned above which might be causing the compilation error.
Please note that based on the provided details in the scenario, no changes to the actual test cases are required as all are adhering to the proper testing structure. Therefore, the issues need to be addressed in other parts of the project or configurations.
