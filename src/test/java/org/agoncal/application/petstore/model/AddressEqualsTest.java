"""
Scenario 1: Test to verify equals method when both objects are the same
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithSameObjects
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when both objects are the same. The target scenario is when the same object is compared with itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set the street1, city, zipcode fields.
  Act: Invoke the equals method by passing the same object as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies that two objects are the same. The expected result is true because the same object is being compared with itself. This test is significant to ensure that the equals method can correctly identify when two Address objects are the same.

Scenario 2: Test to verify equals method when objects are different
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentObjects
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when the objects are different. The target scenario is when two different Address objects are compared.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two different Address objects and set the street1, city, zipcode fields with different values for each object.
  Act: Invoke the equals method by passing the second object as a parameter to the equals method of the first object.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies that two objects are different. The expected result is false because two different objects with different values are being compared. This test is significant to ensure that the equals method can correctly identify when two Address objects are different.

Scenario 3: Test to verify equals method when objects have same values
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithObjectsHavingSameValues
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when the objects have the same values. The target scenario is when two different Address objects having the same values are compared.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two different Address objects and set the street1, city, zipcode fields with the same values for each object.
  Act: Invoke the equals method by passing the second object as a parameter to the equals method of the first object.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies that two objects have the same values. The expected result is true because two objects with the same values are being compared. This test is significant to ensure that the equals method can correctly identify when two Address objects have the same values.

Scenario 4: Test to verify equals method when the object is null
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithNullObject
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when the object is null. The target scenario is when a null object is compared with an Address object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set the street1, city, zipcode fields.
  Act: Invoke the equals method by passing null as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies that the object is null. The expected result is false because a null object is being compared with an Address object. This test is significant to ensure that the equals method can correctly handle a null object.
