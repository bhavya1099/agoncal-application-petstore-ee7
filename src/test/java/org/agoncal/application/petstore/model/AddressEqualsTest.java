"""
Scenario 1: Test for identical addresses

Details:  
  TestName: testIdenticalAddresses
  Description: This test is meant to check that the equals method returns true when comparing an address object to itself. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, passing in the same address object as a parameter. 
  Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies when two address objects are identical. This is important for preventing duplicates in collections of addresses.

Scenario 2: Test for null object

Details:  
  TestName: testNullObject
  Description: This test is meant to check that the equals method returns false when the compared object is null. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, passing in null as a parameter. 
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies a null object. This is crucial for avoiding NullPointerExceptions.

Scenario 3: Test for different class object

Details:  
  TestName: testDifferentClassObject
  Description: This test is meant to check that the equals method returns false when the compared object is not an instance of the Address class. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and a non-Address object.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, passing in the non-Address object as a parameter. 
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies when the compared object is not an instance of the Address class. This is important for maintaining type safety.

Scenario 4: Test for different addresses

Details:  
  TestName: testDifferentAddresses
  Description: This test is meant to check that the equals method returns false when the compared object is an Address, but its field values are different. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with different field values.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, passing in the second address object as a parameter. 
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies when two Address objects have different field values. This is crucial for maintaining accurate data representation.

Scenario 5: Test for equivalent addresses

Details:  
  TestName: testEquivalentAddresses
  Description: This test is meant to check that the equals method returns true when the compared object is an Address with the same field values. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with identical field values.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, passing in the second address object as a parameter. 
  Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies when two Address objects have the same field values. This is important for maintaining data integrity and consistency.
