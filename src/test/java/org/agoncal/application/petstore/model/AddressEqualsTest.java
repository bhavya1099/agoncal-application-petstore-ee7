Scenario 1: Test to verify equals method when both objects are the same
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithSameObjects
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when both objects are the same. The target scenario is when the same object is compared with itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object.
  Act: Invoke the equals method by passing the same object as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is true.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method returns true when the same object is compared. This is expected as per the equals method contract in Java. The significance of this test is to ensure that the equals method behaves as expected when the same object is compared.

Scenario 2: Test to verify equals method when the other object is null
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithNullObject
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when the other object is null. The target scenario is when null is passed as a parameter to the equals method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object.
  Act: Invoke the equals method by passing null as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method returns false when null is passed as a parameter. This is expected as per the equals method contract in Java. The significance of this test is to ensure that the equals method behaves as expected when null is compared.

Scenario 3: Test to verify equals method when the objects are of different classes
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentClassObject
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when the objects are of different classes. The target scenario is when an object of a different class is passed as a parameter to the equals method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and an object of a different class.
  Act: Invoke the equals method by passing the object of a different class as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method returns false when an object of a different class is passed as a parameter. This is expected as per the equals method contract in Java. The significance of this test is to ensure that the equals method behaves as expected when objects of different classes are compared.

Scenario 4: Test to verify equals method when the objects have the same data
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithSameDataObjects
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when the objects have the same data. The target scenario is when two different objects having the same data are compared.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with the same data.
  Act: Invoke the equals method by passing one object as a parameter to the equals method of the other.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is true.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method returns true when two different objects having the same data are compared. This is expected as per the equals method contract in Java. The significance of this test is to ensure that the equals method behaves as expected when objects having the same data are compared.

Scenario 5: Test to verify equals method when the objects have different data
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentDataObjects
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when the objects have different data. The target scenario is when two different objects having different data are compared.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with different data.
  Act: Invoke the equals method by passing one object as a parameter to the equals method of the other.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method returns false when two different objects having different data are compared. This is expected as per the equals method contract in Java. The significance of this test is to ensure that the equals method behaves as expected when objects having different data are compared.
