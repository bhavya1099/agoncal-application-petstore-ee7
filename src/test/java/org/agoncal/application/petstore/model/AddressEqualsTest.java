Here are the test scenarios for the `equals` method:
**Scenario 1: Same Object Comparison**
Details:
TestName: sameObjectComparison
Description: Test if the `equals` method returns true when comparing the same object instance.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the `Address` class.
Act: Call the `equals` method with the same object instance as the parameter.
Assert: Verify that the method returns true.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the `equals` method correctly identifies the same object instance. This test ensures that the method behaves correctly when comparing an object with itself.
**Scenario 2: Different Object Comparison**
Details:
TestName: differentObjectComparison
Description: Test if the `equals` method returns false when comparing two different object instances.
Execution:
Arrange: Create two separate instances of the `Address` class with different field values.
Act: Call the `equals` method with the second object instance as the parameter.
Assert: Verify that the method returns false.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the `equals` method correctly distinguishes between two different object instances. This test ensures that the method behaves correctly when comparing two distinct objects.
**Scenario 3: Null Object Comparison**
Details:
TestName: nullObjectComparison
Description: Test if the `equals` method returns false when comparing an object with null.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the `Address` class.
Act: Call the `equals` method with null as the parameter.
Assert: Verify that the method returns false.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the `equals` method correctly handles null comparisons. This test ensures that the method behaves correctly when comparing an object with null.
**Scenario 4: Same Field Values Comparison**
Details:
TestName: sameFieldValuesComparison
Description: Test if the `equals` method returns true when comparing two objects with the same field values.
Execution:
Arrange: Create two instances of the `Address` class with the same field values.
Act: Call the `equals` method with the second object instance as the parameter.
Assert: Verify that the method returns true.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the `equals` method correctly identifies objects with the same field values. This test ensures that the method behaves correctly when comparing two objects with identical field values.
**Scenario 5: Different Street1 Values Comparison**
Details:
TestName: differentStreet1ValuesComparison
Description: Test if the `equals` method returns false when comparing two objects with different street1 values.
Execution:
Arrange: Create two instances of the `Address` class with different street1 values.
Act: Call the `equals` method with the second object instance as the parameter.
Assert: Verify that the method returns false.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the `equals` method correctly distinguishes between objects with different street1 values. This test ensures that the method behaves correctly when comparing two objects with different street1 values.
**Scenario 6: Different City Values Comparison**
Details:
TestName: differentCityValuesComparison
Description: Test if the `equals` method returns false when comparing two objects with different city values.
Execution:
Arrange: Create two instances of the `Address` class with different city values.
Act: Call the `equals` method with the second object instance as the parameter.
Assert: Verify that the method returns false.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the `equals` method correctly distinguishes between objects with different city values. This test ensures that the method behaves correctly when comparing two objects with different city values.
**Scenario 7: Different Zipcode Values Comparison**
Details:
TestName: differentZipcodeValuesComparison
Description: Test if the `equals` method returns false when comparing two objects with different zipcode values.
Execution:
Arrange: Create two instances of the `Address` class with different zipcode values.
Act: Call the `equals` method with the second object instance as the parameter.
Assert: Verify that the method returns false.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the `equals` method correctly distinguishes between objects with different zipcode values. This test ensures that the method behaves correctly when comparing two objects with different zipcode values.
**Scenario 8: Street1 Null Comparison**
Details:
TestName: street1NullComparison
Description: Test if the `equals` method returns false when comparing two objects with null street1 values.
Execution:
Arrange: Create two instances of the `Address` class with null street1 values.
Act: Call the `equals` method with the second object instance as the parameter.
Assert: Verify that the method returns false.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the `equals` method correctly handles null street1 values. This test ensures that the method behaves correctly when comparing two objects with null street1 values.
**Scenario 9: City Null Comparison**
Details:
TestName: cityNullComparison
Description: Test if the `equals` method returns false when comparing two objects with null city values.
Execution:
Arrange: Create two instances of the `Address` class with null city values.
Act: Call the `equals` method with the second object instance as the parameter.
Assert: Verify that the method returns false.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the `equals` method correctly handles null city values. This test ensures that the method behaves correctly when comparing two objects with null city values.
**Scenario 10: Zipcode Null Comparison**
Details:
TestName: zipcodeNullComparison
Description: Test if the `equals` method returns false when comparing two objects with null zipcode values.
Execution:
Arrange: Create two instances of the `Address` class with null zipcode values.
Act: Call the `equals` method with the second object instance as the parameter.
Assert: Verify that the method returns false.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the `equals` method correctly handles null zipcode values. This test ensures that the method behaves correctly when comparing two objects with null zipcode values.
