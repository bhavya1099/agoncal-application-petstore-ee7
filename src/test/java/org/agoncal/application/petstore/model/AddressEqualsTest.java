Scenario 1: Test to verify equals method when both objects are the same
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithSameObjects
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when both objects are the same. The target scenario is when the same object is compared with itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set the street1, city, zipcode fields.
  Act: Invoke the equals method by passing the same object as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies that two objects are the same. The expected result is true because the same object is being compared with itself. The significance of this test is to ensure that the equals method correctly identifies the same objects.

Scenario 2: Test to verify equals method when objects have different classes
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentClasses
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when the objects belong to different classes. The target scenario is when an object is compared with another object of a different class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and a Country object.
  Act: Invoke the equals method by passing the Country object as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies that two objects belong to different classes. The expected result is false because objects from different classes cannot be equal. The significance of this test is to ensure that the equals method correctly identifies objects of different classes.

Scenario 3: Test to verify equals method when objects have same class but different field values
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithSameClassDifferentValues
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when the objects belong to the same class but have different field values. The target scenario is when two Address objects with different street1, city, or zipcode values are compared.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with different street1, city, or zipcode values.
  Act: Invoke the equals method by passing the second Address object as a parameter to the equals method of the first Address object.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies that two objects of the same class with different field values are not equal. The expected result is false because objects with different field values cannot be equal. The significance of this test is to ensure that the equals method correctly identifies objects with different field values.

Scenario 4: Test to verify equals method when objects have same class and same field values
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithSameClassSameValues
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when the objects belong to the same class and have the same field values. The target scenario is when two Address objects with the same street1, city, and zipcode values are compared.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with the same street1, city, and zipcode values.
  Act: Invoke the equals method by passing the second Address object as a parameter to the equals method of the first Address object.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies that two objects of the same class with the same field values are equal. The expected result is true because objects with the same field values are considered equal. The significance of this test is to ensure that the equals method correctly identifies objects with the same field values.
