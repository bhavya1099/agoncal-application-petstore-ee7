Here are the test scenarios for the `equals` method:
**Scenario 1: Same Object Reference**
TestName: sameObjectReference
Description: Test that the `equals` method returns true when comparing an object to itself.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an `Address` object with some sample data.
Act: Call the `equals` method with the same object reference as the parameter.
Assert: Use JUnit's `assertTrue` to verify that the result is true.
Validation: This test ensures that the `equals` method correctly handles the case where the object being compared is the same as the object being called on. This is a fundamental property of the `equals` method.
**Scenario 2: Null Object Reference**
TestName: nullObjectReference
Description: Test that the `equals` method returns false when comparing an object to null.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an `Address` object with some sample data.
Act: Call the `equals` method with null as the parameter.
Assert: Use JUnit's `assertFalse` to verify that the result is false.
Validation: This test ensures that the `equals` method correctly handles the case where the object being compared is null. This is an important edge case to handle, as null is a common value in many systems.
**Scenario 3: Different Class Type**
TestName: differentClassType
Description: Test that the `equals` method returns false when comparing an object to an object of a different class.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an `Address` object with some sample data and an object of a different class (e.g., `String`).
Act: Call the `equals` method with the different class object as the parameter.
Assert: Use JUnit's `assertFalse` to verify that the result is false.
Validation: This test ensures that the `equals` method correctly handles the case where the object being compared is of a different class. This is an important case to handle, as it ensures that the method is not overly permissive.
**Scenario 4: Same Fields**
TestName: sameFields
Description: Test that the `equals` method returns true when comparing two objects with the same field values.
Execution:
Arrange: Create two `Address` objects with the same field values (e.g., street1, city, zipcode).
Act: Call the `equals` method with the second object as the parameter.
Assert: Use JUnit's `assertTrue` to verify that the result is true.
Validation: This test ensures that the `equals` method correctly handles the case where the objects being compared have the same field values. This is the core functionality of the `equals` method.
**Scenario 5: Different Fields**
TestName: differentFields
Description: Test that the `equals` method returns false when comparing two objects with different field values.
Execution:
Arrange: Create two `Address` objects with different field values (e.g., street1, city, zipcode).
Act: Call the `equals` method with the second object as the parameter.
Assert: Use JUnit's `assertFalse` to verify that the result is false.
Validation: This test ensures that the `equals` method correctly handles the case where the objects being compared have different field values. This is an important case to handle, as it ensures that the method is not overly permissive.
**Scenario 6: Null Fields**
TestName: nullFields
Description: Test that the `equals` method returns false when comparing two objects with null field values.
Execution:
Arrange: Create two `Address` objects with null field values (e.g., street1, city, zipcode).
Act: Call the `equals` method with the second object as the parameter.
Assert: Use JUnit's `assertFalse` to verify that the result is false.
Validation: This test ensures that the `equals` method correctly handles the case where the objects being compared have null field values. This is an important edge case to handle, as null is a common value in many systems.
**Scenario 7: Country Field**
TestName: countryField
Description: Test that the `equals` method ignores the `country` field when comparing two objects.
Execution:
Arrange: Create two `Address` objects with different `country` field values but the same other field values.
Act: Call the `equals` method with the second object as the parameter.
Assert: Use JUnit's `assertTrue` to verify that the result is true.
Validation: This test ensures that the `equals` method correctly ignores the `country` field when comparing two objects. This is an important case to handle, as the `country` field is not used in the `equals` method.
Note that these test scenarios cover the main cases for the `equals` method, including same object reference, null object reference, different class type, same fields, different fields, null fields, and country field. These tests ensure that the `equals` method behaves correctly in various scenarios.
