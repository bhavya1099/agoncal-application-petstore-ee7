Scenario 1: Validate getState Method When State is Set
Details:
  TestName: validateGetStateWhenStateIsSet
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getState method returns the state that has been set using the setState method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set state using setState method.
  Act: Invoke the getState method on the Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned state against the state that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getState method correctly returns the state that was set. The test validates the functionality of the getState method, ensuring it correctly retrieves the state from the Address object.

Scenario 2: Validate getState Method When State is Not Set
Details:
  TestName: validateGetStateWhenStateIsNotSet
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getState method returns null when the state has not been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object without setting a state.
  Act: Invoke the getState method on the Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned state is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getState method correctly handles a scenario where the state has not been set. This test is significant as it checks the robustness of the method in handling such edge cases.

Scenario 3: Validate getState Method When State is Empty
Details:
  TestName: validateGetStateWhenStateIsEmpty
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getState method returns an empty string when the state has been set to an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set state as an empty string using setState method.
  Act: Invoke the getState method on the Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned state is an empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getState method correctly handles a scenario where the state has been set to an empty string. This test is significant as it checks the robustness of the method in handling such edge cases.

Scenario 4: Validate getState Method With Different State Values
Details:
  TestName: validateGetStateWithVariousStateValues
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getState method correctly returns various state values that are set using the setState method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple Address objects and set different state values using setState method.
  Act: Invoke the getState method on each Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned state against the state that was set for each Address object.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getState method can handle a variety of state values and correctly return them. This test is significant as it checks the versatility and correctness of the getState method.
