"""
  Scenario 1: Test to check if the getState method returns the correct state.

  Details:
    TestName: testGetStateReturnsCorrectState
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getState method is returning the correct state that was previously set using the setState method.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class. Set the state using the setState method.
    Act: Invoke the getState method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned state with the state that was set.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getState method is functioning correctly by returning the correct state. The expected result is that the returned state should match the state that was set. This test is significant in ensuring that the state information is accurately retrieved.

  Scenario 2: Test to check if the getState method returns null when no state is set.

  Details:
    TestName: testGetStateReturnsNullWhenNoStateIsSet
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getState method returns null when no state has been set using the setState method.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class without setting a state.
    Act: Invoke the getState method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to assert that the returned state is null.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getState method is functioning correctly by returning null when no state has been set. The expected result is that the returned state should be null. This test is significant in ensuring that the state information is accurately retrieved when no state is set.

  Scenario 3: Test to check if the getState method returns the correct state after multiple setState calls.

  Details:
    TestName: testGetStateReturnsCorrectStateAfterMultipleSetStateCalls
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getState method returns the correct state after the state has been changed multiple times using the setState method.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class. Set the state multiple times using the setState method.
    Act: Invoke the getState method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned state with the last state that was set.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getState method is functioning correctly by returning the correct state after multiple changes. The expected result is that the returned state should match the last state that was set. This test is significant in ensuring that the state information is accurately retrieved after multiple changes.
