""" 
Scenario 1: Test getState method when the state is set
Details:  
  TestName: testGetStateWhenStateIsSet
  Description: This test scenario is designed to check the functionality of the getState method when the state has been set. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set the state using the setState method.
  Act: Invoke the getState method on the Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned state against the state that was set initially.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getState method returns the correct state that was set. The expected result is the state that was set initially. This test is significant to ensure that the getState method is working as expected.

Scenario 2: Test getState method when the state is not set
Details:  
  TestName: testGetStateWhenStateIsNotSet
  Description: This test scenario is designed to check the functionality of the getState method when the state has not been set. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object without setting the state.
  Act: Invoke the getState method on the Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned state against null.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getState method returns null when the state has not been set. The expected result is null. This test is significant to ensure that the getState method returns null as expected when the state is not set.

Scenario 3: Test getState method with different state values
Details:  
  TestName: testGetStateWithDifferentStateValues
  Description: This test scenario is designed to check the functionality of the getState method with different state values. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple Address objects and set different state values using the setState method.
  Act: Invoke the getState method on each Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned state against the state that was set initially for each Address object.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getState method returns the correct state that was set for each Address object. The expected result is the state that was set initially for each Address object. This test is significant to ensure that the getState method is working as expected with different state values.
