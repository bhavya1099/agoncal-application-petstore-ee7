Scenario 1: Test to Check if getState() Returns the Correct State Value

Details:
  TestName: getStateReturnsCorrectValue
  Description: This test is designed to check if the getState() method correctly returns the state that has been set for the Address object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set a known state value using setState().
  Act: Call the getState() method on the Address object.
  Assert: Check that the returned state matches the known state value that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getState() method correctly retrieves the state value that has been set for the Address object. This is crucial for ensuring that the state data for each Address object can be accurately retrieved when needed.

Scenario 2: Test to Check if getState() Returns Null when No State is Set

Details:
  TestName: getStateReturnsNullWhenNotSet
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getState() method correctly returns null when no state has been set for the Address object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object without setting a state.
  Act: Call the getState() method on the Address object.
  Assert: Check that the returned state is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getState() method correctly handles the situation when no state has been set for the Address object. This is important for preventing errors or incorrect data from being returned when the state data is not available.

Scenario 3: Test to Check if getState() Returns the Correct State After Multiple setState() Calls

Details:
  TestName: getStateReturnsCorrectValueAfterMultipleSetStateCalls
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getState() method correctly returns the latest state that has been set for the Address object, even after multiple setState() calls.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set different state values multiple times using setState().
  Act: Call the getState() method on the Address object.
  Assert: Check that the returned state matches the latest state value that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getState() method correctly retrieves the latest state value that has been set for the Address object, regardless of the number of times setState() has been called. This is crucial for ensuring that the most up-to-date state data is always retrieved.
