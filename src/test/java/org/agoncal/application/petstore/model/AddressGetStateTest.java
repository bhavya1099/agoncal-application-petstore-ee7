"""
Scenario 1: Test to verify if the getState method returns the correct state value
Details:
  TestName: testValidStateValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getState method returns the correct state value as set in the object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class and set a known state value.
  Act: Invoke the getState method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned state value matches the known state value set earlier.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getState method correctly retrieves the state value from the object. The expected result is the same state value that was set, demonstrating that the method is working as expected.
Scenario 2: Test to verify if the getState method returns null when state is not set
Details:
  TestName: testNullStateValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getState method returns null when the state value is not set in the object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class without setting the state value.
  Act: Invoke the getState method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned state value is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getState method correctly handles the scenario where the state value is not set. The expected result is null, which is the default value of the state field.
Scenario 3: Test to verify getState method's behavior with empty state
Details:
  TestName: testEmptyStateValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getState method returns an empty string when the state value is set as an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class and set the state value as an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the getState method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned state value is an empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getState method correctly handles the scenario where the state value is an empty string. The expected result is an empty string, demonstrating that the method is correctly retrieving the value of the state field.
Scenario 4: Test to verify getState method's behavior with state containing spaces
Details:
  TestName: testStateValueWithSpaces
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getState method returns the correct state value when the state contains spaces.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class and set the state value as a string containing spaces.
  Act: Invoke the getState method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned state value matches the state value set earlier, including the spaces.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getState method correctly handles the scenario where the state value contains spaces. The expected result is the same state value that was set, including the spaces, demonstrating that the method is correctly retrieving the value of the state field.
