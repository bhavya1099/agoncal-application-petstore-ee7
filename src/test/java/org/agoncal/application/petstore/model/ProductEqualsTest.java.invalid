``` 
Scenario 1: Test equals with identical product objects

Details:  
  TestName: testEqualsWithIdenticalProducts
  Description: This test checks if the equals method returns true when comparing a product object to itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a single Product object and set its name and description.
  Act: Call the equals method, comparing the product object to itself.
  Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the equals method correctly identifies two references to the same object as equal. This is important to ensure object uniqueness in collections that rely on equals, such as Set.

Scenario 2: Test equals with two different product objects having the same name and description

Details:  
  TestName: testEqualsWithTwoProductsSameNameAndDescription
  Description: This test checks if the equals method returns true when comparing two different product objects with the same name and description.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two different Product objects with the same name and description.
  Act: Call the equals method to compare these two objects.
  Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the equals method uses the name and description fields to evaluate equality, which is crucial for ensuring that logically identical products are treated as such in business logic and data storage.

Scenario 3: Test equals with two different product objects having different names

Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentNames
  Description: This test checks if the equals method returns false when comparing two product objects with different names but the same description.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Product objects with different names and the same description.
  Act: Call the equals method to compare these two objects.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the equals method correctly evaluates objects as unequal if their names differ. This is significant for maintaining correct entity identification and processing in the application.

Scenario 4: Test equals with two different product objects having different descriptions

Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentDescriptions
  Description: This test checks if the equals method returns false when comparing two product objects with the same name but different descriptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Product objects with the same name but different descriptions.
  Act: Call the equals method to compare these two objects.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the equals method correctly evaluates objects as unequal if their descriptions differ, which is essential for accurate product differentiation and handling.

Scenario 5: Test equals with null comparison object

Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithNull
  Description: This test checks if the equals method returns false when comparing a product object with null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product object and set its name and description.
  Act: Call the equals method, comparing the product object to null.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the equals method safely handles null inputs and correctly identifies a product as unequal to null, which is crucial for avoiding NullPointerExceptions in application logic.

Scenario 6: Test equals with a different class object

Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentClassObject
  Description: This test checks if the equals method returns false when comparing a product object with an object of a different class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product object and a String object.
  Act: Call the equals method, comparing the product object to the String object.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the equals method correctly identifies objects of different classes as unequal, which is important for correct type handling and error prevention in the application.
