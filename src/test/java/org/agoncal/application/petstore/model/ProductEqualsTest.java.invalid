``` 
Scenario 1: Test equality of two identical Product objects

Details:
  TestName: testEqualityOfIdenticalProducts
  Description: This test verifies that two Product objects with the same name and description are considered equal.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two Product objects with the same name and description.
    Act: Call the equals method on one object passing the other object as a parameter.
    Assert: Ensure that the result is true.
  Validation:
    This test is crucial as it confirms that the equals method correctly identifies identical Product objects.

Scenario 2: Test inequality of two different Product objects

Details:
  TestName: testInequalityOfDifferentProducts
  Description: This test ensures that two Product objects with different names or descriptions are not considered equal.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two Product objects with different names or descriptions.
    Act: Call the equals method on one object passing the other object as a parameter.
    Assert: Verify that the result is false.
  Validation:
    By checking the inequality of different Product objects, this test validates the correctness of the equals method.

Scenario 3: Test equality of a Product object with itself

Details:
  TestName: testEqualityOfProductWithItself
  Description: This test validates that a Product object is equal to itself.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Product object.
    Act: Call the equals method on the object passing itself as a parameter.
    Assert: Confirm that the result is true.
  Validation:
    Ensuring that a Product object is equal to itself is a fundamental requirement for the equals method.

Scenario 4: Test equality with a null object

Details:
  TestName: testEqualityWithNullObject
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the equals method when comparing with a null object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Product object and set another object as null.
    Act: Call the equals method on the Product object passing null as a parameter.
    Assert: Validate that the result is false.
  Validation:
    Verifying the handling of null objects in the equals method is essential for robustness.

Scenario 5: Test equality with a different class object

Details:
  TestName: testEqualityWithDifferentClassObject
  Description: This test examines the response of the equals method when compared with an object of a different class.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Product object and another object of a different class.
    Act: Invoke the equals method on the Product object passing the different class object.
    Assert: Ensure that the result is false.
  Validation:
    Confirming that the equals method correctly identifies objects of different classes as unequal is important for consistency.
