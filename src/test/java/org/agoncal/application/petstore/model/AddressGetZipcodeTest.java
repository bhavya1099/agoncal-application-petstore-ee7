ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getZipcode_3a16b4b54f

Based on the provided information and requirements, here are several test scenarios for the `getZipcode()` method of the Address class:

Scenario 1: Retrieve Valid Zipcode

Details:
  TestName: retrieveValidZipcode
  Description: Verify that the getZipcode method correctly returns a valid zipcode that has been set.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set a valid zipcode using the setZipcode method.
  Act: Call the getZipcode method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned zipcode matches the one that was set.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the getZipcode method correctly retrieves the zipcode value that was previously set. It validates the basic functionality of the getter method and confirms that the zipcode is stored and retrieved accurately.

Scenario 2: Retrieve Null Zipcode

Details:
  TestName: retrieveNullZipcode
  Description: Verify that the getZipcode method returns null when no zipcode has been set.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Address object without setting any zipcode.
  Act: Call the getZipcode method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is null.

Validation:
  This test checks the behavior of getZipcode when no zipcode has been set. It ensures that the method handles the default state correctly by returning null, which is the initial value of the zipcode field.

Scenario 3: Retrieve Empty String Zipcode

Details:
  TestName: retrieveEmptyStringZipcode
  Description: Verify that the getZipcode method correctly returns an empty string when it has been set as such.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set the zipcode to an empty string using the setZipcode method.
  Act: Call the getZipcode method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned zipcode is an empty string.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the getZipcode method correctly handles and returns an empty string zipcode. It's important to verify that empty strings are not converted to null or handled differently.

Scenario 4: Retrieve Zipcode After Multiple Sets

Details:
  TestName: retrieveZipcodeAfterMultipleSets
  Description: Verify that the getZipcode method returns the most recently set zipcode value.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object, set an initial zipcode, then set a different zipcode.
  Act: Call the getZipcode method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned zipcode matches the most recently set value.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the getZipcode method always returns the most up-to-date zipcode value, even after multiple changes. It validates that the setter and getter methods work together correctly to maintain the current state of the zipcode.

Scenario 5: Verify Zipcode in toString Method

Details:
  TestName: verifyZipcodeInToString
  Description: Ensure that the zipcode is correctly included in the string representation of the Address object.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set a specific zipcode.
  Act: Call the toString method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned string contains the correct zipcode.

Validation:
  This test checks if the zipcode is correctly included in the string representation of the Address object. It ensures that the toString method accurately reflects the state of the zipcode field, which is important for debugging and logging purposes.

These scenarios cover various aspects of the getZipcode method, including normal operation, edge cases (null and empty string), and its interaction with other methods in the Address class. They aim to ensure the reliability and correctness of the zipcode retrieval functionality.
