Below are the test scenarios for the `getZipcode` method from the `Address` class. This method returns the `zipcode` property of the `Address` instance. Given the information, these tests will cover various standard scenarios including null and valid data cases:

**Scenario 1: Test retrieval of null zipcode**

  Details:
    TestName: shouldReturnNullIfZipcodeNotSet
    Description: Checks the behavior of `getZipcode` when no zipcode has been set (zipcode is null).
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of `Address` without setting the zipcode.
    Act: Call `getZipcode()` on this instance.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.
  Validation:
    Validates that `getZipcode` correctly handles the state where no zipcode has been explicitly set. This test is significant as it checks the class’s ability to handle default (null) values, reflecting situations where some address details might be initially unknown.

**Scenario 2: Test to retrieve a valid zipcode**

  Details:
    TestName: shouldReturnCorrectZipcodeWhenSet
    Description: Ensures the `getZipcode` method returns the correct zipcode that was previously set.
  Execution:
    Arrange:
      - Create an instance of `Address`.
      - Use `setZipcode` to apply a known zipcode value.
    Act: Call `getZipcode()` and obtain the result.
    Assert: Check that the returned value matches the set zipcode.
  Validation:
    Verifies the accuracy and reliability of `getZipcode` in yielding a non-null, correct zipcode value. This is crucial for validating user input and ensuring data integrity in address management.

**Scenario 3: Test retrieval of zipcode after altering the value**

  Details:
    TestName: shouldReturnUpdatedZipcodeAfterChange
    Description: Validates that updating the zipcode field with a new value properly impacts the outcome of `getZipcode`.
  Execution:
    Arrange:
      - Create an `Address` instance and set an initial zipcode.
      - Change the zipcode to a new value.
    Act: Call `getZipcode()` to fetch the updated zipcode.
    Assert: Confirm that the returned zipcode matches the newly set value.
  Validation:
    This test is important to ensure that changes made to the zipcode field are accurately reflected via the getter, which is crucial for applications where address details may be dynamically updated.

**Scenario 4: Test behavior of zipcode retrieval in a deep copy scenario**

  Details:
    TestName: shouldReturnSameZipcodeOnClonedObjectIfNotModified
    Description: Checks if the `getZipcode` method returns the same zipcode for a cloned Address object, assuming no modification to the zipcode.
  Execution:
    Arrange:
      - Create and set up an original `Address` object with a zipcode.
      - Clone this Address object.
    Act: Retrieve the zipcode from both the original and the cloned instance using `getZipcode()`.
    Assert: Assert that both zipcodes are identical.
  Validation:
    Ensures that cloning an object does not alter the retrieval of zipcode properties. Essential for features that involve copying or replicating address data without alterations.

These scenarios systematically cover functionality from basic retrieval to effects of class manipulation, helping ensure the robustness of the `Address` class’s zipcode handling.
