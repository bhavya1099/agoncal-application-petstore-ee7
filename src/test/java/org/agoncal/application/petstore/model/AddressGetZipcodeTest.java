Based on the provided method and class information, here are several test scenarios for the `getZipcode()` method:
Scenario 1: Return Zipcode When Set
Details:
  TestName: getZipcodeWhenSet
  Description: Verify that the getZipcode method returns the correct zipcode when it has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set a valid zipcode.
  Act: Call the getZipcode method.
  Assert: Verify that the returned zipcode matches the one that was set.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getZipcode method correctly returns the zipcode value when it has been properly set. It validates the basic functionality of the getter method.
Scenario 2: Return Null When Zipcode Not Set
Details:
  TestName: getZipcodeWhenNotSet
  Description: Verify that the getZipcode method returns null when the zipcode has not been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class without setting the zipcode.
  Act: Call the getZipcode method.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  This test checks the behavior of the getZipcode method when the zipcode field has not been initialized. It ensures that the method handles the default state correctly.
Scenario 3: Return Empty String When Zipcode Set to Empty
Details:
  TestName: getZipcodeWhenSetToEmpty
  Description: Verify that the getZipcode method returns an empty string when the zipcode has been set to an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the zipcode to an empty string.
  Act: Call the getZipcode method.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is an empty string.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getZipcode method correctly handles the case when the zipcode is explicitly set to an empty string, which is different from null.
Scenario 4: Return Correct Zipcode After Multiple Sets
Details:
  TestName: getZipcodeAfterMultipleSets
  Description: Verify that the getZipcode method returns the most recently set zipcode after multiple sets.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class, set a zipcode, then set a different zipcode.
  Act: Call the getZipcode method.
  Assert: Verify that the returned zipcode matches the most recently set value.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getZipcode method always returns the most up-to-date zipcode value, validating that the setter correctly updates the field.
Scenario 5: Return Zipcode When Other Address Fields Are Set
Details:
  TestName: getZipcodeWhenOtherAddressFieldsSet
  Description: Verify that the getZipcode method returns the correct zipcode when other address fields (street1, city, state) are also set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class, set values for street1, city, state, and zipcode.
  Act: Call the getZipcode method.
  Assert: Verify that the returned zipcode matches the set value, regardless of other field values.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getZipcode method works correctly in the context of a fully populated address object, verifying that other fields do not interfere with the zipcode retrieval.
These test scenarios cover various aspects of the getZipcode method, including normal operation, edge cases, and potential interactions with other fields in the class. They aim to ensure the method behaves correctly under different conditions.
