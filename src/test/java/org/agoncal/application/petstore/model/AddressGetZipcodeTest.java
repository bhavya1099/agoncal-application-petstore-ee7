"""
  Scenario 1: Test to verify the correct zipcode is returned from the getZipcode method

  Details:
    TestName: testGetZipcode
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getZipcode method. The target scenario is when a Zipcode is set and then retrieved using getZipcode method.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set a zipcode using setZipcode method.
    Act: Invoke the getZipcode method on the created instance.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned zipcode against the expected zipcode.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the getZipcode method returns the expected zipcode. The expected result is the same zipcode that was set using the setZipcode method. This test is significant as it confirms the functionality of the getZipcode method in retrieving the zipcode.

  Scenario 2: Test to verify that getZipcode method returns null when no zipcode is set

  Details:
    TestName: testGetZipcodeWhenNotSet
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getZipcode method when no zipcode is set. The target scenario is when the getZipcode method is invoked without setting a zipcode.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class without setting a zipcode.
    Act: Invoke the getZipcode method on the created instance.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned zipcode is null.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the getZipcode method returns null when no zipcode is set. The expected result is null. This test is significant as it confirms the behavior of the getZipcode method in the absence of a set zipcode.

  Scenario 3: Test to verify that setting a new zipcode updates the return value of getZipcode method

  Details:
    TestName: testGetZipcodeAfterUpdate
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getZipcode method after updating the zipcode. The target scenario is when a new zipcode is set after a previous one and the getZipcode method is invoked.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set a zipcode. Then, update the zipcode to a new value.
    Act: Invoke the getZipcode method on the created instance.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned zipcode is the newly set zipcode.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the getZipcode method returns the updated zipcode. The expected result is the new zipcode that was set after updating. This test is significant as it confirms the ability of the getZipcode method to retrieve the latest set zipcode.
