Here are the generated test scenarios for the `getZipcode()` method:
**Scenario 1: Get Zipcode with Valid Address**
Details:
  TestName: getZipcodeWithValidAddress
  Description: Test the `getZipcode()` method with a valid address object having a populated zipcode field.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a valid address, including a non-null and non-empty zipcode.
  Act: Call the `getZipcode()` method on the instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned zipcode matches the expected value.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `getZipcode()` method correctly returns the zipcode value when the address object is properly initialized. This is a basic sanity check to verify the method's functionality.
**Scenario 2: Get Zipcode with Empty Zipcode**
Details:
  TestName: getZipcodeWithEmptyZipcode
  Description: Test the `getZipcode()` method with an address object having an empty zipcode field.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with an address object having an empty zipcode field.
  Act: Call the `getZipcode()` method on the instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned zipcode is an empty string.
Validation:
  This test checks the method's behavior when the zipcode field is empty. It ensures that the method returns an empty string, as expected.
**Scenario 3: Get Zipcode with Null Zipcode**
Details:
  TestName: getZipcodeWithNullZipcode
  Description: Test the `getZipcode()` method with an address object having a null zipcode field.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with an address object having a null zipcode field.
  Act: Call the `getZipcode()` method on the instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned zipcode is null.
Validation:
  This test checks the method's behavior when the zipcode field is null. It ensures that the method returns null, as expected.
**Scenario 4: Get Zipcode with Null Address**
Details:
  TestName: getZipcodeWithNullAddress
  Description: Test the `getZipcode()` method with a null address object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a null address object.
  Act: Call the `getZipcode()` method on the instance.
  Assert: Verify that a NullPointerException is thrown.
Validation:
  This test checks the method's behavior when the address object is null. It ensures that a NullPointerException is thrown, as expected.
**Scenario 5: Get Zipcode with Partially Populated Address**
Details:
  TestName: getZipcodeWithPartiallyPopulatedAddress
  Description: Test the `getZipcode()` method with an address object having some fields populated, but not all.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with an address object having some fields populated (e.g., street1, city), but not all (e.g., zipcode is null or empty).
  Act: Call the `getZipcode()` method on the instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned zipcode matches the expected value (either null or empty).
Validation:
  This test checks the method's behavior when the address object is partially populated. It ensures that the method returns the expected zipcode value, even if not all fields are populated.
These test scenarios cover various edge cases and error handling for the `getZipcode()` method, ensuring that it behaves correctly in different situations.
