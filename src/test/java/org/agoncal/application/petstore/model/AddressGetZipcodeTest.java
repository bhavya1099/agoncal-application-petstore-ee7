Based on the provided information and the method `getZipcode()`, here are several test scenarios for the Address entity:
```
Scenario 1: Retrieve Valid Zipcode
Details:
  TestName: retrieveValidZipcode
  Description: Verify that the getZipcode method returns the correct zipcode when it has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set a valid zipcode using the setZipcode method.
  Act: Call the getZipcode method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned zipcode matches the one that was set.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getZipcode method correctly retrieves the zipcode value that was previously set. It validates the basic functionality of the getter method.
Scenario 2: Retrieve Null Zipcode
Details:
  TestName: retrieveNullZipcode
  Description: Check that the getZipcode method returns null when no zipcode has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Address object without setting any zipcode.
  Act: Call the getZipcode method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the getZipcode method behaves correctly when no zipcode has been set, returning null as expected. It's important to handle potential null values in the application logic.
Scenario 3: Retrieve Zipcode After Multiple Sets
Details:
  TestName: retrieveZipcodeAfterMultipleSets
  Description: Ensure that the getZipcode method returns the most recently set zipcode value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object, set an initial zipcode, then set a different zipcode.
  Act: Call the getZipcode method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned zipcode matches the most recently set value.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the getZipcode method always returns the most up-to-date zipcode value, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity when the zipcode is modified.
Scenario 4: Verify Zipcode in toString Method
Details:
  TestName: verifyZipcodeInToString
  Description: Check that the zipcode is correctly included in the string representation of the Address object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set a specific zipcode.
  Act: Call the toString method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned string contains the correct zipcode.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the zipcode is properly represented in the string output of the Address object, which is important for logging and debugging purposes.
Scenario 5: Verify Zipcode in Equals Method
Details:
  TestName: verifyZipcodeInEquals
  Description: Confirm that the equals method correctly compares Address objects based on their zipcode (among other fields).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with the same street1, city, and zipcode values.
  Act: Call the equals method to compare these objects.
  Assert: Verify that the equals method returns true.
Validation:
  This test validates that the equals method correctly considers the zipcode when determining object equality, which is crucial for proper object comparison and collection operations.
Scenario 6: Verify Zipcode in HashCode Method
Details:
  TestName: verifyZipcodeInHashCode
  Description: Ensure that the hashCode method incorporates the zipcode in its calculation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with the same street1, city, and zipcode values.
  Act: Calculate the hashCode for both objects.
  Assert: Verify that both objects have the same hashCode.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the zipcode is factored into the hashCode calculation, which is essential for consistent behavior when using Address objects in hash-based collections.
```
These scenarios cover various aspects of the `getZipcode()` method and its interaction with other methods in the Address entity. They test the basic functionality, null handling, consistency across multiple operations, and its role in object representation and comparison.
