ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getZipcode_3a16b4b54f

Scenario 1: Test to check if the getZipcode method returns the correct zipcode.

Details:  
  TestName: checkGetZipcodeReturnsCorrectZipcode.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getZipcode method correctly returns the zipcode that was previously set using the setZipcode method.  
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set a known zipcode using the setZipcode method.
  Act: Invoke the getZipcode method on the Address instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned zipcode with the expected zipcode.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getZipcode method correctly retrieves the zipcode that was previously set. The expected result is that the two zipcodes match, ensuring that the get and set methods for zipcode work correctly.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the getZipcode method returns null if no zipcode was set.

Details:  
  TestName: checkGetZipcodeReturnsNullIfNotSet.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getZipcode method returns null when no zipcode has been set using the setZipcode method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class without setting a zipcode.
  Act: Invoke the getZipcode method on the Address instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned zipcode is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getZipcode method correctly handles cases where no zipcode has been set, by returning null. The expected result is that the returned zipcode is null, ensuring that the get method for zipcode works correctly when no zipcode has been set.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the getZipcode method returns the correct zipcode when it has been changed.

Details:  
  TestName: checkGetZipcodeReturnsCorrectZipcodeWhenChanged.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getZipcode method correctly returns the updated zipcode after it has been changed using the setZipcode method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set a known zipcode. Then update the zipcode with a new value using the setZipcode method.
  Act: Invoke the getZipcode method on the Address instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned zipcode with the updated zipcode.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getZipcode method correctly retrieves the updated zipcode after it has been changed. The expected result is that the two zipcodes match, ensuring that the get and set methods for zipcode work correctly when the zipcode is updated.
