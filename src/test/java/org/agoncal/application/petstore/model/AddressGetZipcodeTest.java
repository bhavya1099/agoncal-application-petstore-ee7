Scenario 1: Valid Zipcode Retrieval

Details:
  TestName: testGetZipcodeOnValidInput
  Description: This test checks if the getZipcode method correctly returns a valid zipcode after it has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a known zipcode using setZipcode method.
  Act: Retrieve the zipcode using the getZipcode method.
  Assert: Verify that the returned zipcode matches the one that was set.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion checks that getZipcode returns precisely what was set, ensuring data integrity and correct getter functionality.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: It's crucial for the application correctness to confirm that the data retrieval methods such as getZipcode works accurately as this can directly impact functionality such as shipping, billing, and location-based services.

Scenario 2: Null Zipcode Retrieval

Details:
  TestName: testGetZipcodeWhenNotSet
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of getZipcode when the zipcode has not been set, expecting it to return null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure no zipcode is set initially on creation of the Address instance.
  Act: Retrieve the zipcode using the getZipcode method.
  Assert: Check if the returned result is null.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion ensures that the method correctly handles cases where the zipcode is not set and should return null.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Validating that getZipcode can return null correctly is integral for scenarios where address data might be partially completed, which can be a common case in various application stages like partial registrations or form entries.

Scenario 3: Test Non-cleared Zipcode Retrieval After Reset

Details:
  TestName: testGetZipcodePersistenceAfterReset
  Description: This test ensures that setting a zipcode, then resetting it to another value, and retrieving it again consistently provides the last set value.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    1. Set an initial zipcode value.
    2. Change to a new zipcode.
  Act: Retrieve the zipcode with getZipcode.
  Assert: The resulting zipcode should match the new value, not the initial one.
Validation:
  Purpose of assertion: To verify that setZipcode correctly updates the zipcode value and getZipcode retrieves the latest set value.
  Importance of the test: This test is critical to verify that the Address object's zipcode property is being updated as expected without retaining past values, particularly vital for situations where address corrections are necessary.
```
This set of scenarios explores different angles through which the `getZipcode` method's reliability and correctness can be tested, ensuring it behaves as expected in various real-world use cases.
