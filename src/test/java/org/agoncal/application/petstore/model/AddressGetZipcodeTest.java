"""
  Scenario 1: Test to verify the correct zipcode is returned
  Details:  
    TestName: testZipcodeIsReturnedCorrectly.
    Description: This test is designed to verify that the getZipcode() method returns the correct zipcode that was previously set using the setZipcode() method.  
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address object and set the zipcode using setZipcode().
    Act: Invoke the getZipcode() method on the Address object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned zipcode against the expected zipcode.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getZipcode() method correctly retrieves the zipcode of the Address object. The expected result is the same zipcode that was set using the setZipcode() method. This test is significant as it ensures the getZipcode() method is working as expected.

  Scenario 2: Test to check if getZipcode() returns null when zipcode is not set
  Details:  
    TestName: testZipcodeReturnsNullWhenNotSet.
    Description: This test is designed to check if the getZipcode() method returns null when the zipcode has not been set.  
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address object without setting the zipcode.
    Act: Invoke the getZipcode() method on the Address object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned zipcode is null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getZipcode() method correctly handles the scenario where the zipcode has not been set and returns null. This test is significant as it checks the robustness of the getZipcode() method.

  Scenario 3: Test to check if getZipcode() returns empty String when zipcode is set as empty
  Details:  
    TestName: testZipcodeReturnsEmptyWhenSetAsEmpty.
    Description: This test is designed to check if the getZipcode() method returns an empty String when the zipcode is set as an empty String.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address object and set the zipcode as an empty String.
    Act: Invoke the getZipcode() method on the Address object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned zipcode is an empty String.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getZipcode() method correctly handles the scenario where the zipcode is set as an empty String and returns an empty String. This test is significant as it checks the robustness of the getZipcode() method.
