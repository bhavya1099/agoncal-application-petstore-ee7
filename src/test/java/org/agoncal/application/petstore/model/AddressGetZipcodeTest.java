"""
  Scenario 1: Test to verify the default value of Zipcode

  Details:
    TestName: testDefaultZipcode.
    Description: This test is designed to verify the default value of zipcode in the Address class. It checks that the zipcode field is null when a new Address object is instantiated.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a new Address object.
    Act: Invoke the getZipcode() method on the new Address object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the zipcode is null.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the zipcode is null by default, which is expected because we have not set any value for it yet. This test ensures that the default state of the Address object is as expected.

  Scenario 2: Test to verify the correct retrieval of Zipcode

  Details:
    TestName: testRetrieveZipcode.
    Description: This test is designed to verify the correct retrieval of zipcode in the Address class. It checks that the getZipcode() method correctly returns the zipcode that was previously set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a new Address object and use the setZipcode() method to set a known value.
    Act: Invoke the getZipcode() method on the Address object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned zipcode matches the known value that was set.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the getZipcode() method correctly retrieves the zipcode that was previously set. This test ensures that the method is functioning as expected.

  Scenario 3: Test to verify the behavior of getZipcode with empty Zipcode

  Details:
    TestName: testGetZipcodeWithEmptyValue.
    Description: This test is designed to verify the behavior of getZipcode() method when the zipcode field is set to an empty string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a new Address object and use the setZipcode() method to set an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the getZipcode() method on the Address object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned zipcode is an empty string.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the getZipcode() method correctly retrieves the zipcode even when it is set to an empty string. This test ensures that the method handles this edge case correctly.

  Scenario 4: Test to verify the behavior of getZipcode with null Zipcode

  Details:
    TestName: testGetZipcodeWithNullValue.
    Description: This test is designed to verify the behavior of getZipcode() method when the zipcode field is set to null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a new Address object and use the setZipcode() method to set null.
    Act: Invoke the getZipcode() method on the Address object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned zipcode is null.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the getZipcode() method correctly retrieves the zipcode even when it is set to null. This test ensures that the method handles this edge case correctly.
