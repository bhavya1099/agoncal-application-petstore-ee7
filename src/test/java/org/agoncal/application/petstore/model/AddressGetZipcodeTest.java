Here are the test scenarios for the `getZipcode()` method:
**Scenario 1: Test Get Zipcode with Null Value**
Details:
  TestName: testGetZipcodeWithNullValue
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the `getZipcode()` method when the `zipcode` field is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with `zipcode` set to null.
  Act: Invoke the `getZipcode()` method on the instance.
  Assert: Use `assertNull` to verify that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method returns null when the `zipcode` field is null, as expected. This is a basic sanity check to verify that the method behaves correctly in this scenario.
**Scenario 2: Test Get Zipcode with Empty String**
Details:
  TestName: testGetZipcodeWithEmptyString
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the `getZipcode()` method when the `zipcode` field is an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with `zipcode` set to an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the `getZipcode()` method on the instance.
  Assert: Use `assertEquals` to verify that the returned value is an empty string.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method returns an empty string when the `zipcode` field is an empty string, as expected. This is a test for a specific edge case where the field is not null but contains no value.
**Scenario 3: Test Get Zipcode with Valid Zipcode**
Details:
  TestName: testGetZipcodeWithValidZipcode
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the `getZipcode()` method when the `zipcode` field contains a valid zipcode.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with `zipcode` set to a valid zipcode (e.g., "12345").
  Act: Invoke the `getZipcode()` method on the instance.
  Assert: Use `assertEquals` to verify that the returned value matches the expected zipcode.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method returns the correct zipcode value when it is set to a valid value. This is a basic test to verify that the method behaves correctly in a normal scenario.
**Scenario 4: Test Get Zipcode with Invalid Zipcode**
Details:
  TestName: testGetZipcodeWithInvalidZipcode
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the `getZipcode()` method when the `zipcode` field contains an invalid zipcode (e.g., "abcde").
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with `zipcode` set to an invalid zipcode.
  Act: Invoke the `getZipcode()` method on the instance.
  Assert: Use `assertEquals` to verify that the returned value matches the expected invalid zipcode.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method returns the same invalid zipcode value, as there is no validation or error handling in the method to handle this scenario.
**Scenario 5: Test Get Zipcode with Country Validation**
Details:
  TestName: testGetZipcodeWithCountryValidation
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the `getZipcode()` method when the `country` field is set to a valid country object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with `country` set to a valid country object and `zipcode` set to a valid zipcode.
  Act: Invoke the `getZipcode()` method on the instance.
  Assert: Use `assertEquals` to verify that the returned value matches the expected zipcode.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method returns the correct zipcode value when the `country` field is set to a valid country object, as the `getZipcode()` method does not perform any country-specific validation.
