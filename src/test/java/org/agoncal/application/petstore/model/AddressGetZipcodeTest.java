Scenario 1: Test to Check if getZipcode Returns the Correct Zipcode Value
Details:
  TestName: testGetZipcodeReturnsCorrectValue
  Description: This test is designed to ensure that the getZipcode method returns the correct zipcode value that has been set for the object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object and set a specific zipcode value for it.
    Act: Invoke the getZipcode method on the created object.
    Assert: Compare the returned value with the set zipcode value.
  Validation:
    This test verifies if the getZipcode method is returning the correct zipcode value. The expected result is the zipcode value that was set during the Arrange phase. This test is significant as it checks the basic functionality of the getZipcode method.
Scenario 2: Test to Check if getZipcode Returns Null for Unset Zipcode Value
Details:
  TestName: testGetZipcodeReturnsNullForUnsetZipcode
  Description: This test checks if the getZipcode method returns null when the zipcode has not been set for the object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object without setting a zipcode value for it.
    Act: Invoke the getZipcode method on the created object.
    Assert: Verify that the returned value is null.
  Validation:
    This test verifies if the getZipcode method returns null for an unset zipcode. The expected result is null. This test is significant as it checks the behavior of the getZipcode method in a scenario where the zipcode has not been set.
Scenario 3: Test to Check if getZipcode Handles Empty Zipcode Value
Details:
  TestName: testGetZipcodeHandlesEmptyZipcode
  Description: This test checks if the getZipcode method can handle an empty zipcode value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object and set an empty string as the zipcode value for it.
    Act: Invoke the getZipcode method on the created object.
    Assert: Verify that the returned value is an empty string.
  Validation:
    This test verifies if the getZipcode method can handle an empty zipcode value. The expected result is an empty string. This test is important as it checks the behavior of the getZipcode method when the zipcode value is empty.
