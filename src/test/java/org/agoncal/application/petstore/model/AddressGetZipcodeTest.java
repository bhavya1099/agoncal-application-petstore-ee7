"""
Scenario 1: Test to Validate Correct Zipcode
Details:
  TestName: testGetZipcode
  Description: This test is designed to check if the getZipcode() method correctly returns the zipcode that has been set for a given Address object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set its zipcode to a known value.
  Act: Invoke the getZipcode() method on the Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against the known value that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getZipcode() method correctly retrieves the zipcode of the Address object. The expected result is that the returned zipcode matches the one that was set, as the correctness of this method is essential for accurate address management in the application.

Scenario 2: Test to Handle Null Zipcode
Details:
  TestName: testGetZipcodeWithNullValue
  Description: This test is designed to check if the getZipcode() method correctly handles a null value for the zipcode.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object without setting a zipcode.
  Act: Invoke the getZipcode() method on the Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getZipcode() method correctly handles a null zipcode. The expected result is a null return value, as the method should be able to handle situations where a zipcode has not been set.

Scenario 3: Test to Validate Zipcode After Changing Value
Details:
  TestName: testGetZipcodeAfterChangingValue
  Description: This test is designed to check if the getZipcode() method correctly returns the updated zipcode after its value has been changed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set its zipcode to a known value. Then, change the zipcode to a different known value.
  Act: Invoke the getZipcode() method on the Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against the updated zipcode value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getZipcode() method correctly retrieves the updated zipcode of the Address object. The expected result is that the returned zipcode matches the updated value, ensuring that the method correctly reflects changes to the zipcode.

Scenario 4: Test to Validate Zipcode in Equals Method
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsMethodWithZipcode
  Description: This test is designed to check if the equals() method correctly considers the zipcode when comparing two Address objects.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with the same street1, city, and zipcode values.
  Act: Invoke the equals() method to compare the two Address objects.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals() method correctly takes the zipcode into account when comparing two Address objects. The expected result is true, as the objects are considered equal if they have the same street1, city, and zipcode values.
