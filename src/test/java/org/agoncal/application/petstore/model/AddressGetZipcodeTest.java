"""
  Scenario 1: Test to verify the correct zipcode is returned from the getZipcode method

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetZipcode
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getZipcode method. The target scenario is when a Zipcode is set and then retrieved using getZipcode method, it should return the correct Zipcode. 

  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set a Zipcode using the setAddress method.
    Act: Invoke the getZipcode method on the Address instance.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned Zipcode against the expected Zipcode.

  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getZipcode method is correctly retrieving the set Zipcode. The expected result is the same Zipcode that was set using the setZipcode method. This test is significant as it ensures that the getZipcode method is functioning as expected, which is crucial for the correct retrieval of Address information.
  
  Scenario 2: Test to verify the getZipcode method when no Zipcode is set

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetZipcodeWhenNotSet
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getZipcode method when no Zipcode is set. The target scenario is when getZipcode method is invoked without setting a Zipcode, it should return null or a default value.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class without setting a Zipcode.
    Act: Invoke the getZipcode method on the Address instance.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned Zipcode against null or a default value.

  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getZipcode method is correctly handling the scenario when no Zipcode is set. The expected result is null or a default value. This test is significant as it ensures that the getZipcode method can handle edge cases and error handling, which is crucial for maintaining the robustness of the application.
