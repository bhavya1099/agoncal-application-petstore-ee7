"""
Scenario 1: Positive test case
Details:
  TestName: getZipcodeWhenValuePresent
  Description: This test will validate the functionality when the zipcode has a valid value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assign a valid zipcode value to the Zipcode field
    Act: Invoke the getZipcode method
    Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the assigned zipcode
  Validation:
    This test verifies that the getZipcode method returns the valid zipcode when it's not null. This is the expected behavior, as the method should return an assigned zipcode value.

Scenario 2: Negative test case when zipcode is null
Details:
  TestName: getZipcodeWhenValueIsNull
  Description: This test will validate the functionality when the zipcode is null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Do not assign a value to the zipcode field, leaving it null.
    Act: Invoke the getZipcode method.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.
  Validation:
    This test verifies that the getZipcode returns null when the zipcode is null. This is the expected behavior, showing that the method does not assign a default value for null.
Scenario 3: Test case to validate non-ASCII characters in the zipcode
Details:
  TestName: getZipcodeWithNonASCIICodes
  Description: This test will validate the scenario when the zipcode includes non-ASCII characters.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assign a value to zipcode that contains non-ASCII characters.
    Act: Invoke the getZipcode method.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the assigned value including non-ASCII characters.
  Validation:
    This test verifies that the getZipcode method returns the assigned value including non-ASCII characters. This is to ensure that the method handles and supports different language scripts.
Scenario 4: Validating zipcode with special characters
Details:
  TestName: getZipcodeWithSpecialCharacters
  Description: This test will validate the scenario when the zipcode includes special characters.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assign a value to zipcode that contains special characters.
    Act: Invoke the getZipcode method.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the assigned value, including special characters.
  Validation:
    This test verifies that the getZipcode method returns the assigned value even if it contains special characters, ensuring the method's flexibility in handling different characters.
