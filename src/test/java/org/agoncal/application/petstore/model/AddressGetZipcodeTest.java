  Scenario 1: Test to verify the correct zipcode is returned from the getZipcode method

  Details:
    TestName: testGetZipcode
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getZipcode method. The target scenario is when a Zipcode is set and then retrieved using getZipcode method.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set a zipcode using the setZipcode method.
    Act: Invoke the getZipcode method on the created instance.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned zipcode against the expected zipcode.

  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the getZipcode method returns the expected zipcode. The expected result is the same zipcode that was set using the setZipcode method. This test is significant as it confirms that the getZipcode method successfully retrieves the correct zipcode from the Address instance.

  Scenario 2: Test to verify that getZipcode returns null when no zipcode is set

  Details:
    TestName: testGetZipcodeWhenNotSet
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getZipcode method when no zipcode has been set.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class without setting a zipcode.
    Act: Invoke the getZipcode method on the created instance.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned value is null.

  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the getZipcode method returns null when no zipcode has been set. This is an expected result as no zipcode was set on the Address instance. This test is significant as it confirms the behavior of the getZipcode method in scenarios where no zipcode has been set.

  Scenario 3: Test to verify that getZipcode returns the correct zipcode after it has been updated

  Details:
    TestName: testGetZipcodeAfterUpdate
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getZipcode method after the zipcode has been updated.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set a zipcode. Then, update the zipcode using the setZipcode method.
    Act: Invoke the getZipcode method on the created instance.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned zipcode against the updated zipcode.

  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the getZipcode method returns the updated zipcode. The expected result is the updated zipcode that was set using the setZipcode method. This test is significant as it confirms that the getZipcode method successfully retrieves the correct, updated zipcode from the Address instance.
