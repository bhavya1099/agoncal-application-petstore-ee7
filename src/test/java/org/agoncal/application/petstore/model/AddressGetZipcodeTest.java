```
Scenario 1: Test retrieving a valid zipcode from Address object

Details:
  TestName: testRetrievingValidZipcode
  Description: Verify that the getZipcode method correctly retrieves the zipcode value from an Address object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address object with a known zipcode value.
    Act: Call the getZipcode method on the Address object.
    Assert: Ensure that the returned zipcode matches the expected value.
  Validation:
    This test confirms that the getZipcode method retrieves the correct zipcode value, which is essential for address validation and identification.

Scenario 2: Test retrieving zipcode when zipcode is null

Details:
  TestName: testRetrievingZipcodeWhenNull
  Description: Validate the behavior of getZipcode method when the zipcode is null in the Address object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address object with a null zipcode value.
    Act: Call the getZipcode method on the Address object.
    Assert: Verify that the returned zipcode is null.
  Validation:
    This test ensures that the getZipcode method handles and returns null when the zipcode field is not set, preventing potential NullPointerExceptions.

Scenario 3: Test equality of zipcode values between two Address objects

Details:
  TestName: testEqualityOfZipcodes
  Description: Check if the equals method correctly compares the zipcode values of two Address objects.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two Address objects with the same and different zipcode values.
    Act: Call the equals method with these Address objects.
    Assert: Confirm that the comparison based on zipcode values returns true for matching zipcodes and false for different zipcodes.
  Validation:
    This test validates the equality logic based on zipcodes in the equals method, which is crucial for address equality checks and comparisons.

Scenario 4: Test hashing of zipcode values in Address object

Details:
  TestName: testHashingOfZipcode
  Description: Ensure that the hashCode method generates consistent hash values for Address objects based on zipcodes.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create Address objects with identical and different zipcode values.
    Act: Calculate the hash code for these Address objects using the hashCode method.
    Assert: Check that Address objects with the same zipcode produce the same hash code, while different zipcodes result in different hash codes.
  Validation:
    This test guarantees that the hashCode method correctly hashes zipcodes, maintaining hash consistency for equal zipcodes and distinct hashes for different zipcodes.

Scenario 5: Test string representation of Address object including the zipcode

Details:
  TestName: testStringRepresentationWithZipcode
  Description: Validate that the toString method includes the zipcode in the string representation of an Address object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address object with known values for all fields including the zipcode.
    Act: Invoke the toString method on the Address object.
    Assert: Ensure that the resulting string contains the zipcode value.
  Validation:
    This test confirms that the toString method correctly incorporates the zipcode, providing a comprehensive textual representation of the Address object.
