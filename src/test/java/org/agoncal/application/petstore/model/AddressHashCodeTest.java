"""
  Scenario 1: Test Hashcode with all Null Values
  Details:
    TestName: testHashcodeWithAllNullValues
    Description: This test case is designed to verify that the hashCode method can handle all null values without throwing an exception.
    Execution:
      Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class with all fields set to null.
      Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the instance.
      Assert: Assert that the returned hashcode is 0.
    Validation:
      The assertion verifies that the hashcode of an object with all null values is 0. This is an important case to handle to ensure the stability of our application when dealing with incomplete data.
  Scenario 2: Test Hashcode with some Null Values
  Details:
    TestName: testHashcodeWithSomeNullValues
    Description: This test case is designed to verify the hashCode method when some of the values used in generating the hashcode are null.
    Execution:
      Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class with 'street1', 'city', and 'zipcode' set to null.
      Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the instance.
      Assert: Assert that the returned hashcode is not null.
    Validation:
      The assertion verifies that the hashcode method can handle some null values and still return a valid hashcode. This is important in ensuring that our application can handle incomplete data.
  Scenario 3: Test Hashcode with Non-Null Values
  Details:
    TestName: testHashcodeWithNonNullValues
    Description: This test case is designed to verify the hashCode method when all the values used in generating the hashcode are non-null.
    Execution:
      Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class with 'street1', 'city', and 'zipcode' set to non-null values.
      Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the instance.
      Assert: Assert that the returned hashcode is not null and not 0.
    Validation:
      The assertion verifies that the hashcode method can generate a valid hashcode when all values are non-null. This is important in ensuring that our application can correctly identify unique instances of objects.
  Scenario 4: Test Hashcode Consistency
  Details:
    TestName: testHashcodeConsistency
    Description: This test case is designed to verify that the hashCode method is consistent, i.e., it returns the same hashcode for the same object every time it is called.
    Execution:
      Arrange: Initialize an instance of the class with 'street1', 'city', and 'zipcode' set to non-null values.
      Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the instance multiple times.
      Assert: Assert that the returned hashcode is the same every time.
    Validation:
      The assertion verifies that the hashcode method is consistent. This is important as inconsistent hashcodes can lead to unexpected behavior in our application.
  Scenario 5: Test Hashcode with two different objects
  Details:
    TestName: testHashcodeWithTwoDifferentObjects
    Description: This test case is designed to verify that the hashCode method generates different hashcodes for two different objects.
    Execution:
      Arrange: Initialize two instances of the class with different 'street1', 'city', and 'zipcode' values.
      Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both instances.
      Assert: Assert that the returned hashcodes are not the same.
    Validation:
      The assertion verifies that the hashcode method can correctly differentiate between two different objects. This is important in ensuring the uniqueness of objects in our application.
