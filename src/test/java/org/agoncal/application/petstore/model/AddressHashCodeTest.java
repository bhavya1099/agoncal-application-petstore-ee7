```
Scenario 1: Test HashCode Calculation with Different Address Objects

Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeCalculationWithDifferentAddresses
  Description: Verify that the hashCode calculation generates unique values for different Address objects with distinct street1, city, and zipcode values.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two Address objects with different street1, city, and zipcode values.
    Act: Calculate the hashCodes for both Address objects.
    Assert: Ensure that the hashCodes are different for the two Address objects.
  Validation:
    The assertion confirms that the hashCode method correctly considers the unique attributes of each Address object to generate distinct hash codes, which is crucial for proper hash-based data structures.

Scenario 2: Test HashCode Calculation with Same Address Object

Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeCalculationWithSameAddress
  Description: Validate that the hashCode calculation results in the same value for the same Address object with identical street1, city, and zipcode values.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address object with the same street1, city, and zipcode values.
    Act: Compute the hashCode for the Address object.
    Assert: Verify that the hashCode remains consistent for the same Address object.
  Validation:
    This test ensures that the hashCode method produces a consistent hash value for identical Address objects, enabling proper retrieval and comparison in hash-based collections.

Scenario 3: Test HashCode Calculation with Null Values

Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeCalculationWithNullValues
  Description: Check if the hashCode calculation handles null values for street1, city, or zipcode attributes.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address object with null values for street1, city, or zipcode.
    Act: Calculate the hashCode for the Address object.
    Assert: Confirm that the hashCode generation handles null values gracefully.
  Validation:
    This scenario confirms that the hashCode method can handle null attributes without causing exceptions, ensuring robustness in scenarios where certain attributes may be missing.

Scenario 4: Test HashCode Calculation Consistency

Details:
  TestName: testConsistentHashCodeCalculation
  Description: Ensure that the hashCode calculation remains consistent across multiple invocations on the same Address object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address object with specific street1, city, and zipcode values.
    Act: Calculate the hashCode multiple times on the same Address object.
    Assert: Validate that the hashCode value remains the same for each invocation.
  Validation:
    This test guarantees that the hashCode method consistently generates the same hash value for a given Address object, which is essential for predictability and stability in hash-based operations.

Scenario 5: Test HashCode Distribution

Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeDistribution
  Description: Validate the distribution of hash codes generated by the hashCode method for a range of Address objects.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create multiple Address objects with varying street1, city, and zipcode values.
    Act: Calculate the hashCodes for all Address objects and analyze the distribution.
    Assert: Ensure that the hash codes are evenly distributed across the range of Address objects.
  Validation:
    This scenario aims to confirm that the hashCode method produces hash values that are well-distributed, promoting efficient storage and retrieval in hash-based data structures.
