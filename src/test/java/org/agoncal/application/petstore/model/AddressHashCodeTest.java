### Test Scenarios for `hashCode()` Method of the Address Class

---

**Scenario 1**: All Address Fields Null

Details:
TestName: testHashCodeWithAllFieldsNull
Description: This test checks the behavior of the `hashCode()` method when all involved fields (`street1`, `city`, and `zipcode`) are `null`.
Execution:
- Arrange: Instantiate an `Address` object without setting any fields.
- Act: Call the `hashCode()` method on this object.
- Assert: Confirm that the hash code returned is consistent with the hash code of `null` for each of these fields (`Objects.hash(null, null, null)`).
Validation:
The assertion verifies that hash code calculation correctly handles `null` inputs. This test is critical because handling null safely prevents runtime exceptions and ensures consistent hash codes for uninitialized `Address` objects.

---

**Scenario 2**: Single Field Non-null

Details:
TestName: testHashCodeWithSingleNonNullField
Description: This test examines the behavior when one of the fields (`street1`) is non-null and others are null.
Execution:
- Arrange: Create an `Address` object, set `street1` to a non-null value (e.g., "123 Main St"), and leave `city` and `zipcode` as `null`.
- Act: Invoke the `hashCode()` method on this object.
- Assert: Check if the hash code matches the hash of the provided values (`Objects.hash("123 Main St", null, null)`).
Validation:
This verifies that the `hashCode()` function correctly computes the hash code when some fields are `null` and others are not. It highlights the method's capacity to handle partial initializations typical in real scenarios, ensuring accurate hash calculations.

---

**Scenario 3**: All Fields Non-null

Details:
TestName: testHashCodeWithAllFieldsNonNull
Description: This scenario tests the `hashCode()` method when all relevant fields are non-null.
Execution:
- Arrange: Initialize an `Address` object with non-null values for `street1`, `city`, and `zipcode`.
- Act: Call the `hashCode()` method of the object.
- Assert: Compare the result with the expected hash code (`Objects.hash("123 Main St", "Anytown", "12345")`).
Validation:
The assertion checks that the hash code is computed correctly when all fields are populated. This test ensures the method's effectiveness in real-world use cases where complete address data is provided, maintaining data integrity across operations such as storage or retrieval in collections.

---

**Scenario 4**: Consistency of HashCode

Details:
TestName: testHashCodeConsistency
Description: This test checks that multiple invocations of `hashCode()` on the same object with unchanged fields yield the same result.
Execution:
- Arrange: Create and set up an `Address` object with particular values for `street1`, `city`, and `zipcode`.
- Act: Invoke `hashCode()` multiple times.
- Assert: Ensure that all invocations return the same hash code.
Validation:
This asserts the consistency of the `hashCode()` output across multiple calls, which is essential for the correct functioning of hash-based collections like `HashSet` or `HashMap`, where inconsistent hash codes could lead to data integrity issues.

---

**Scenario 5**: Different Objects, Same Fields

Details:
TestName: testHashCodeForEqualObjects
Description: Verify that two different `Address` objects with identical field values have the same hash code.
Execution:
- Arrange: Instantiate two different `Address` objects, setting the same values for `street1`, `city`, and `zipcode` in both.
- Act: Call the `hashCode()` method on both objects.
- Assert: Check that both objects return the same hash code.
Validation:
This test ensures that the hash code is based purely on the object's data and not on the object's memory address or identity. It is crucial for the correct operation of collections that use hash codes to determine object equality, such as in the case of keys in a `HashMap`.

These scenarios collectively ensure the robust testing of the `hashCode()` method in various typical and edge cases, highlighting potential issues and verifying that the Address classâ€™s implementation adheres to expected behaviors in hash coding.
