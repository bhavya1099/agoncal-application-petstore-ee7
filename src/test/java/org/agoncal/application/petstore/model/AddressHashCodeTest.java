Based on the provided method and class information, here are several test scenarios for the `hashCode()` method:
Scenario 1: Consistent Hash Code for Same Object
Details:
  TestName: consistentHashCodeForSameObject
  Description: Verify that the hashCode method returns the same value when called multiple times on the same object with unchanged state.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object with non-null values for street1, city, and zipcode.
  Act: Call hashCode() multiple times on the same object.
  Assert: Compare the hash codes to ensure they are identical.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the hashCode method is consistent, which is a fundamental contract of the hashCode method in Java. Consistency is crucial for proper functioning of hash-based collections.
Scenario 2: Different Hash Codes for Different Objects
Details:
  TestName: differentHashCodesForDifferentObjects
  Description: Verify that two objects with different values for street1, city, or zipcode produce different hash codes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two objects with different values for at least one of street1, city, or zipcode.
  Act: Calculate hash codes for both objects.
  Assert: Compare the hash codes to ensure they are different.
Validation:
  This test checks that the hashCode method can differentiate between objects with different relevant field values, which is important for proper distribution in hash-based collections.
Scenario 3: Equal Hash Codes for Equal Objects
Details:
  TestName: equalHashCodesForEqualObjects
  Description: Verify that two objects with the same values for street1, city, and zipcode produce the same hash code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two separate objects with identical values for street1, city, and zipcode.
  Act: Calculate hash codes for both objects.
  Assert: Compare the hash codes to ensure they are equal.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the hashCode method adheres to the contract that equal objects must have equal hash codes, which is crucial for consistency with the equals method.
Scenario 4: Hash Code with Null Values
Details:
  TestName: hashCodeWithNullValues
  Description: Verify that the hashCode method handles null values for street1, city, and zipcode without throwing exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object with null values for street1, city, and zipcode.
  Act: Call hashCode() on the object.
  Assert: Verify that a hash code is returned without throwing a NullPointerException.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the hashCode method is null-safe, which is important for robustness and preventing unexpected runtime errors.
Scenario 5: Hash Code Ignores Unused Fields
Details:
  TestName: hashCodeIgnoresUnusedFields
  Description: Verify that changing values of fields not used in hashCode calculation (street2, state, country) does not affect the hash code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two objects with the same street1, city, and zipcode, but different values for street2, state, and country.
  Act: Calculate hash codes for both objects.
  Assert: Compare the hash codes to ensure they are equal.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the hashCode method correctly focuses only on the specified fields (street1, city, zipcode) and ignores others, maintaining consistency with the method's implementation.
Scenario 6: Hash Code with Empty Strings
Details:
  TestName: hashCodeWithEmptyStrings
  Description: Verify that the hashCode method handles empty strings for street1, city, and zipcode correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object with empty strings for street1, city, and zipcode.
  Act: Call hashCode() on the object.
  Assert: Verify that a hash code is returned and it's consistent with repeated calls.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the hashCode method handles edge cases like empty strings properly, which is important for objects that might have valid but empty string fields.
These scenarios cover various aspects of the hashCode method, including consistency, differentiation, equality, null handling, field selection, and edge cases, providing a comprehensive test suite for the given implementation.
