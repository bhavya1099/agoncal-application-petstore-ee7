```
Scenario 1: Consistent HashCode for Same Address Values
Details:
  TestName: checkConsistencyOfHashCodes
  Description: This test checks if the hashCode method returns the same hash code for an Address object when called multiple times, ensuring consistency in hash code generation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address and set the street1, city, and zipcode properties.
  Act: Call the hashCode method multiple times on the same Address instance.
  Assert: Assert that the hash codes returned from each call are equal.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the hashCode method is consistent across multiple calls, which is crucial for the correct functionality of hash-based collections like HashSet and HashMap. Consistency is key in avoiding misplacement or loss of objects within such collections.
Scenario 2: Different HashCodes for Addresses with Different Values
Details:
  TestName: verifyDifferentHashCodesForDifferentAddresses
  Description: This test ensures that the hashCode method generates different hash codes for Address objects with different property values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of Address with different values for street1, city, or zipcode.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on both instances.
  Assert: Assert that the hash codes returned for the two addresses are not equal.
Validation:
  This test checks the effectiveness of the hashCode method in producing distinct hash codes for distinct addresses, which helps in reducing hash collisions in collections and ensures efficient data retrieval and storage.
Scenario 3: Same HashCodes for Addresses with Identical Values
Details:
  TestName: checkHashCodesForIdenticalAddressValues
  Description: This test verifies that two distinct Address objects with identical values for street1, city, and zipcode yield the same hash code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two different Address instances and set identical values for street1, city, and zipcode on both.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on each instance.
  Assert: Assert that the hash codes are the same for both instances.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the hashCode method adheres to the contract that equal objects must have equal hash codes, which is important for the correct operation of Java collections that use hashing.
Scenario 4: HashCode Consistency with Equals Method
Details:
  TestName: ensureHashCodeConsistencyWithEquals
  Description: This test checks the contract between equals and hashCode methods, ensuring that two objects that are equal according to the equals method also have the same hash code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address instances with the same values for street1, city, and zipcode and ensure they are equal using the equals method.
  Act: Retrieve the hash codes of both instances.
  Assert: Assert that the hash codes are identical.
Validation:
  This assertion ensures compliance with the Java contract that states if two objects are equal according to the equals method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce the same result. This is fundamental for the correct functioning of hash-based collections.
Scenario 5: Effect of Null Values in Properties on HashCode
Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithNullProperties
  Description: This test examines how the hashCode method handles null values in the street1, city, or zipcode fields, ensuring it does not throw a NullPointerException.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address instance and set street1, city, or zipcode to null.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on this instance.
  Assert: Assert that the method completes without throwing an exception.
Validation:
  This test is significant as it checks the robustness of the hashCode implementation against null values, which is crucial for avoiding runtime exceptions in applications.
