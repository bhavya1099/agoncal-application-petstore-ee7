"""
Scenario 1: Test hashCode with identical Address objects

Details:  
  TestName: testHashCodeWithIdenticalObjects
  Description: This test is designed to check that the hashCode method generates the same hash for two Address objects with identical properties.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with the same 'street1', 'city', and 'zipcode' properties.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both objects.
  Assert: Assert that the two hashcodes are equal.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the hashCode method generates the same hash for objects with the same properties. This is significant as it ensures that identical objects are treated as equal by collections that use hash codes, such as HashMap or HashSet.

Scenario 2: Test hashCode with different Address objects

Details:  
  TestName: testHashCodeWithDifferentObjects
  Description: This test is designed to check that the hashCode method generates different hashes for two Address objects with different properties.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with different 'street1', 'city', and 'zipcode' properties.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both objects.
  Assert: Assert that the two hashcodes are not equal.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the hashCode method generates different hashes for objects with different properties. This is significant as it ensures that different objects are treated as distinct by collections that use hash codes.

Scenario 3: Test hashCode with null properties

Details:  
  TestName: testHashCodeWithNullProperties
  Description: This test is designed to check that the hashCode method can handle Address objects with null properties without throwing exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object with null 'street1', 'city', and 'zipcode' properties.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the object.
  Assert: Assert that the hashCode method does not throw a NullPointerException.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the hashCode method can handle null properties without throwing exceptions. This is significant as it ensures that the application does not crash when trying to generate a hash code for an object with null properties.
