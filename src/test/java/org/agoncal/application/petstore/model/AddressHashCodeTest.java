Based on the provided information, here are some test scenarios for the `hashCode()` method of the Address entity:
```
Scenario 1: Verify hashCode() returns consistent values for the same object
Details:
  TestName: consistentHashCode
  Description: This test ensures that multiple invocations of hashCode() on the same Address object return the same integer value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object with specific street1, city, and zipcode values.
  Act: Call hashCode() multiple times on the same Address object.
  Assert: Verify that all calls return the same hash code.
Validation:
  This test confirms that hashCode() is consistent for a given object, which is crucial for the proper functioning of hash-based collections. It ensures that an Address object will always be placed in the same bucket in a HashMap or HashSet, allowing for efficient retrieval.
Scenario 2: Verify different Address objects with the same relevant field values have the same hash code
Details:
  TestName: equalAddressesSameHashCode
  Description: This test checks if two different Address objects with the same street1, city, and zipcode values produce the same hash code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two different Address objects with identical street1, city, and zipcode values.
  Act: Call hashCode() on both Address objects.
  Assert: Verify that both calls return the same hash code.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the hashCode() method correctly implements the contract with equals(). If two objects are equal according to the equals() method, their hash codes should be the same. This is important for maintaining consistency in hash-based collections.
Scenario 3: Verify different Address objects with different relevant field values have different hash codes
Details:
  TestName: differentAddressesDifferentHashCodes
  Description: This test verifies that two Address objects with different street1, city, or zipcode values produce different hash codes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with different values for street1, city, or zipcode.
  Act: Call hashCode() on both Address objects.
  Assert: Verify that the hash codes are different.
Validation:
  This test checks that the hashCode() method can differentiate between distinct Address objects. While it's theoretically possible for different objects to have the same hash code (hash collision), this test helps ensure that the method provides a good distribution of hash codes for different inputs.
Scenario 4: Verify hashCode() is not affected by non-relevant fields
Details:
  TestName: hashCodeIgnoresIrrelevantFields
  Description: This test ensures that changes to fields not used in the hashCode() calculation (street2, state, country) do not affect the hash code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and store its hash code. Then modify the street2, state, and country fields.
  Act: Call hashCode() again after modifying the non-relevant fields.
  Assert: Verify that the hash code remains the same as the original.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the hashCode() method correctly focuses only on the relevant fields (street1, city, zipcode) as specified in the implementation. It ensures that modifications to other fields do not unexpectedly change the object's hash code, which could lead to issues in hash-based collections.
Scenario 5: Verify hashCode() handles null values gracefully
Details:
  TestName: hashCodeWithNullValues
  Description: This test checks if the hashCode() method can handle null values for street1, city, or zipcode without throwing exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object with null values for street1, city, or zipcode.
  Act: Call hashCode() on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the method executes without throwing a NullPointerException.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the hashCode() method is robust and can handle potential null values without crashing. It's important for maintaining the stability of the application, especially when dealing with potentially incomplete or invalid data.
```
These test scenarios cover various aspects of the `hashCode()` method, including consistency, equality contract, differentiation, irrelevant field handling, and null value handling. They aim to ensure that the method behaves correctly under different circumstances and maintains the expected properties of a good hash function.
