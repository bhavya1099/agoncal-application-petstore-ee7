"""
Scenario 1: Test to validate the hashCode method when all fields are provided

Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithAllFields
  Description: This test aims to validate the hashCode method when the street1, city, and zipcode fields are provided. The hash value should be consistent for the same object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with the same street1, city, and zipcode values.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both objects.
  Assert: Assert that the hash values of both objects are equal.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the hash values for two Address objects with the same street1, city, and zipcode are equal. This is important to ensure the consistency of the hashCode method.

Scenario 2: Test to validate the hashCode method when different objects are provided

Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithDifferentObjects
  Description: This test aims to validate the hashCode method when different objects are provided. The hash value should be different for different objects.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with different street1, city, and zipcode values.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both objects.
  Assert: Assert that the hash values of both objects are not equal.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the hash values for two Address objects with different street1, city, and zipcode are not equal. This is important to ensure the uniqueness of the hashCode method.

Scenario 3: Test to validate the hashCode method when some fields are null

Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithNullFields
  Description: This test aims to validate the hashCode method when some of the fields are null. The hash value should still be calculated correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object with null values for some of the fields.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the object.
  Assert: Assert that the hash value is not null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the hash value is not null even when some of the fields are null. This is important to ensure the robustness of the hashCode method.

Scenario 4: Test to validate the hashCode method when all fields are null

Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithAllNullFields
  Description: This test aims to validate the hashCode method when all of the fields are null. The hash value should still be calculated correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object with null values for all the fields.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the object.
  Assert: Assert that the hash value is not null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the hash value is not null even when all of the fields are null. This is important to ensure the robustness of the hashCode method.

Scenario 5: Test to validate the hashCode method with the same objects

Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithSameObjects
  Description: This test aims to validate the hashCode method with the same objects. The hash value should be same for the same objects.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and assign it to two different references.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both references.
  Assert: Assert that the hash values of both references are equal.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the hash values for two references pointing to the same object are equal. This is important to ensure the consistency of the hashCode method.
