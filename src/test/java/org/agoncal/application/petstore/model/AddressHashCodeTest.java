  Scenario 1: Test Hashcode for Identical Addresses

  Details:  
    TestName: testHashcodeForIdenticalAddresses
    Description: This test aims to check if the hashCode method returns the same hashcode for two identical Address objects. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two identical Address objects with the same street1, city, and zipcode.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both Address objects.
    Assert: Assert that the two hashCodes are equal.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the hashCode method is consistent and returns the same hashCode for two identical objects. This is important as per the contract of the hashCode method in Java.

  Scenario 2: Test Hashcode for Different Addresses

  Details:  
    TestName: testHashcodeForDifferentAddresses
    Description: This test aims to check if the hashCode method returns different hashcodes for two different Address objects.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two different Address objects with different street1, city, and zipcode.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both Address objects.
    Assert: Assert that the two hashCodes are not equal.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the hashCode method returns different hashCodes for two different objects. This is important as it reduces the chances of collisions in collections that use hashing.

  Scenario 3: Test Hashcode Consistency

  Details:  
    TestName: testHashcodeConsistency
    Description: This test aims to check if the hashCode method is consistent and returns the same hashcode on multiple invocations.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address object.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the Address object multiple times.
    Assert: Assert that the hashCode value remains the same across multiple invocations.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the hashCode method is consistent. This is important as per the contract of the hashCode method in Java, which states that multiple invocations of hashCode on the same object must return the same integer value.

  Scenario 4: Test Hashcode for Null Values

  Details:  
    TestName: testHashcodeForNullValues
    Description: This test aims to check if the hashCode method can handle null values for street1, city, and zipcode without throwing a NullPointerException.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address object with null values for street1, city, and zipcode.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the Address object.
    Assert: Assert that the hashCode method does not throw a NullPointerException.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the hashCode method can handle null values. This is important as it ensures the robustness of the code.

/*
The test case `testHashcodeForNullValues` is failing because of an incorrect assertion. The test case is trying to verify that the hash code of an Address object with all null values should be zero. But, the actual hash code returned by the `hashCode()` method is not zero.

In the `hashCode()` method, the `Objects.hash(street1, city, zipcode)` is used to generate the hash code. The `Objects.hash()` method uses the `Arrays.hashCode()` internally which calculates the hash code for each input object and returns the cumulative hash code. If all input objects are null, it doesn't return zero, instead, it returns a hash code calculated based on the number of input objects, which in this case is 3. 

Hence, when the test case is asserting that the hash code should be zero, it fails because the actual hash code is not zero. The assertion error log `java.lang.AssertionError: expected:<0> but was:<29791>` clearly indicates this scenario. 

To fix this test, the assertion should be updated to expect the correct hash code when all the properties are null. Alternatively, if the business requirement is to return zero when all properties are null, then the `hashCode()` method in the business logic should be updated to handle this scenario.
