ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashCode_44411a81c8

Based on the provided information and the hashCode() method, here are several test scenarios for the Address class:

Scenario 1: Consistent Hash Code for Same Object

Details:
  TestName: consistentHashCodeForSameObject
  Description: Verify that the hashCode() method returns the same value when called multiple times on the same object.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object with sample values for street1, city, and zipcode.
  Act: Call hashCode() multiple times on the same object.
  Assert: Compare the hash codes to ensure they are the same.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the hashCode() method is consistent for the same object, which is a fundamental requirement for the hashCode() contract. It's crucial for the proper functioning of hash-based collections.

Scenario 2: Different Hash Codes for Different Objects

Details:
  TestName: differentHashCodesForDifferentObjects
  Description: Verify that two Address objects with different values produce different hash codes.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with different values for street1, city, and zipcode.
  Act: Calculate the hash code for both objects.
  Assert: Compare the hash codes to ensure they are different.

Validation:
  This test verifies that the hashCode() method produces different results for objects with different content, which is important for distributing objects across hash-based collections.

Scenario 3: Same Hash Code for Equal Objects

Details:
  TestName: sameHashCodeForEqualObjects
  Description: Verify that two Address objects with the same values for street1, city, and zipcode produce the same hash code.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with the same values for street1, city, and zipcode.
  Act: Calculate the hash code for both objects.
  Assert: Compare the hash codes to ensure they are the same.

Validation:
  This test ensures that objects that are considered equal (based on the equals() method) have the same hash code, which is a requirement of the hashCode() contract.

Scenario 4: Hash Code Calculation with Null Values

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeCalculationWithNullValues
  Description: Verify that the hashCode() method handles null values for street1, city, or zipcode without throwing exceptions.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object with null values for street1, city, and zipcode.
  Act: Call the hashCode() method on this object.
  Assert: Verify that no exception is thrown and a hash code is returned.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the hashCode() method is robust and can handle null values without crashing, which is important for preventing NullPointerExceptions in hash-based collections.

Scenario 5: Hash Code Independence from Non-Hashed Fields

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeIndependenceFromNonHashedFields
  Description: Verify that changing fields not used in hashCode() calculation (street2, state, country) does not affect the hash code.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object with values for all fields.
  Act: Calculate the initial hash code, then change street2, state, and country, and recalculate the hash code.
  Assert: Compare the hash codes to ensure they remain the same.

Validation:
  This test verifies that the hashCode() method only depends on the fields specified in its implementation (street1, city, zipcode) and is not affected by other fields, which is important for maintaining consistency with the equals() method.

These test scenarios cover various aspects of the hashCode() method, including consistency, differentiation, equality, null handling, and independence from non-hashed fields. They aim to ensure that the hashCode() method behaves correctly and adheres to the general contract for hashCode() in Java.
