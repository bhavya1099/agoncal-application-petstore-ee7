### Scenario 1: Consistent HashCode on Multiple Invocations

**Details:**
  TestName: testMultipleInvocationsProvideSameHashCode
  Description: Validates that multiple invocations of the hashCode method on the same object instance yield the same result, ensuring consistency.

**Execution:**
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class with predetermined values for `street1`, `city`, and `zipcode`.
  Act: Call the hashCode method multiple times on the same Address instance.
  Assert: Compare the hash codes from each invocation to confirm they are equal.

**Validation:**
  This verification ensures that the Address object's hashCode computation is deterministic and stable as long as the object is not modified. This property is crucial for correct behavior when Address instances are used in collections like HashSet or HashMap.

---

### Scenario 2: Different Addresses Have Different HashCodes

**Details:**
  TestName: testDifferentAddressesHaveDifferentHashCodes
  Description: Checks that different Address instances (with different field values) usually have distinct hash codes.

**Execution:**
  Arrange: Create two instances of the Address class with different `street1`, `city`, or `zipcode` values.
  Act: Retrieve the hash code for each instance.
  Assert: Assert that the two hash codes are not the same.

**Validation:**
  This test ensures that the hash function provides a reasonable spread of hashcodes, which is important to minimize collisions in hash-based collections and maintain efficient performance.

---

### Scenario 3: Same Fields Yield Same HashCode

**Details:**
  TestName: testIdenticalAddressesYieldSameHashCode
  Description: Ensures that two distinct Address instances with identical field values yield the same hash code.

**Execution:**
  Arrange: Create two different Address objects, but initialize them with the same `street1`, `city`, and `zipcode`.
  Act: Retrieve the hash code for each Address object.
  Assert: Check that both hash codes are identical.

**Validation:**
  Demonstrates that equal Address objects as per the equal fields criterion produce the same hash code, supporting correct behavior in hash-based collections and affirming the implementation of the hashCode contract.

---

### Scenario 4: Null Values in Fields

**Details:**
  TestName: testHashCodeWithNullValues
  Description: Evaluates how the hashCode method handles Address instances where nullable fields (`street1`, `city`, `zipcode`) are set to null.

**Execution:**
  Arrange: Create an Address where one or more of the nullable fields are explicitly set to null.
  Act: Retrieve the hash code of this Address instance.
  Assert: Ensure that the operation completes successfully without exceptions.

**Validation:**
  Facilitates verification that the hashCode method is robust against nulls, reflecting good defensive programming practices and ensuring the method doesn't throw runtime exceptions when encountering null values.

---

These scenarios should cover most of the reasonable edge cases and typical use cases for the hashCode method in the Address class.
