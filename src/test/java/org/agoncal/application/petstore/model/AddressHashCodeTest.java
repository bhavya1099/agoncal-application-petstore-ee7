"""
  Scenario 1: Verify hashCode method when all String fields are null
  Details:
    TestName: testHashCodeWhenAllFieldsAreNull.
    Description: The test is meant to check the hashCode method when all String fields (street1, city, zipcode) are null. Since these are part of the hashCode, the result should be consistent and not depend on other object's state.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set street1, city and zipcode to null.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the hashCode returns the same value every time.
  Validation:
    This test verifies that the hashCode method works as expected even when all fields used in it are null. The test checks the contract of hashCode method, requiring consistent results as long as object doesn't change.
  Scenario 2: Verify hashCode method for same field values
  Details:
    TestName: testHashCodeForSameFieldValues.
    Description: The goal is to check if the hashCode method returns the same value when invoked on two objects with the same street1, city and zipcode. This feature is a requirement by the contract of the hashCode method.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two objects with the same street1, city and zipcode.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both objects.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if both hashCodes are equal.
  Validation:
    This test ensures that the hashCode method follows the contract that two equal objects must have the same hashCode, where equality is determined by the values of street1, city and zipcode.
  Scenario 3: Different hashCode for different city field
  Details:
    TestName: testHashCodeForDifferentCity.
    Description: This test verifies if the hashCode method returns different values for two objects that are different only in the city field. While it's not mandatory that different objects have different hashCodes, it's a good property that improves performance in collections.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up two objects with same street1 and zipcode but different city.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both objects.
    Assert: Check with JUnit assertions if the hashCodes obtained are different.
  Validation:
    This test verifies the effectiveness of the hashCode method in differentiating objects based on their city field. This is important because it increases the efficiency of data structures utilizing hashCodes.
