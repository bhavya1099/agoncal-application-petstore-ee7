  Scenario 1: Test Hashcode for Identical Addresses

  Details:  
    TestName: testHashcodeForIdenticalAddresses
    Description: This test aims to check if the hashCode method returns the same hashcode for two identical Address objects. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two identical Address objects with the same street1, city, and zipcode.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both Address objects.
    Assert: Assert that the two hashCodes are equal.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the hashCode method is consistent and returns the same hashCode for two identical objects. This is important as it ensures that the hashCode method adheres to its contract, which is crucial for the correct operation of collections that rely on the hashCode method.

  Scenario 2: Test Hashcode for Different Addresses

  Details:  
    TestName: testHashcodeForDifferentAddresses
    Description: This test aims to check if the hashCode method returns different hashcodes for two different Address objects. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two different Address objects with different street1, city, or zipcode.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both Address objects.
    Assert: Assert that the two hashCodes are not equal.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the hashCode method correctly distinguishes between different objects. This is important as it ensures that different objects are not mistakenly treated as equal by collections that rely on the hashCode method.

  Scenario 3: Test Hashcode Consistency

  Details:  
    TestName: testHashcodeConsistency
    Description: This test aims to check if the hashCode method returns the same hashCode on repeated invocations. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address object.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the same Address object multiple times.
    Assert: Assert that the hashCodes returned from all invocations are equal.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the hashCode method is consistent across multiple invocations, which is a key requirement of the hashCode contract. This is important as inconsistent hashCodes can lead to unpredictable behavior in collections that rely on the hashCode method.

  Scenario 4: Test Hashcode for Null Fields

  Details:  
    TestName: testHashcodeForNullFields
    Description: This test aims to check if the hashCode method handles null fields correctly. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address object with null street1, city, and zipcode.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the Address object.
    Assert: Assert that a hashCode is returned without throwing a NullPointerException.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the hashCode method can handle null fields without throwing an exception. This is important as it ensures that the application remains robust and doesn't crash due to null pointer exceptions when handling addresses with null fields.
