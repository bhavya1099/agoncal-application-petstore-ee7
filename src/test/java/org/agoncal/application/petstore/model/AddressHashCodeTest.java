  Scenario 1: Test Hashcode for Identical Addresses

  Details:
    TestName: testHashcodeForIdenticalAddresses
    Description: This test aims to check if the hashCode method returns the same hashcode for two identical Address objects.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two identical Address objects with the same street1, city, and zipcode.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both Address objects.
    Assert: Assert that the two hashCodes are equal.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the hashCode method generates the same hash value for identical Address objects. This is important as it confirms the consistency of the hashCode method in line with the Java hashCode contract.

  Scenario 2: Test Hashcode for Different Addresses

  Details:
    TestName: testHashcodeForDifferentAddresses
    Description: This test aims to check if the hashCode method returns different hashcodes for two different Address objects.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two different Address objects with different street1, city, and zipcode.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both Address objects.
    Assert: Assert that the two hashCodes are not equal.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the hashCode method generates different hash values for different Address objects. This is important as it confirms the integrity of the hashCode method in distinguishing different Address objects.

  Scenario 3: Test Hashcode Consistency

  Details:
    TestName: testHashcodeConsistency
    Description: This test aims to check if the hashCode method consistently returns the same hashCode for the same Address object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address object.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the Address object multiple times.
    Assert: Assert that the hashCode is consistent across multiple invocations.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the hashCode method returns a consistent hash value for the same object across multiple invocations. This is important as it confirms the consistency of the hashCode method, which is a key aspect of the Java hashCode contract.

  Scenario 4: Test Hashcode for Null Fields

  Details:
    TestName: testHashcodeForNullFields
    Description: This test aims to check if the hashCode method handles null fields properly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address object with null values for street1, city, and zipcode.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the Address object.
    Assert: Assert that the hashCode method does not throw a NullPointerException.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the hashCode method can handle Address objects with null fields. This is important as it confirms the robustness of the hashCode method in handling null values.
