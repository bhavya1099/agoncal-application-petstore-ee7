```
Scenario 1: Address with regular data
Details:
  TestName: hashWithRegularData
  Description: Check if the hashCode method returns a consistent hash code for an Address object initialized with typical data.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object with street1, city, and zipcode.
  Act: Call hashCode method on the Address object.
  Assert: Validate that a non-zero integer is returned as a hash code.
Validation:
  Clarify that the hash code returned should correctly represent the object's data and be consistent on multiple invocations. The test verifies the correct calculation and stability of the hash function, which is critical for using Address objects in hash-based collections.

Scenario 2: Address with null values
Details:
  TestName: hashWithNullValues
  Description: Verify that the hashCode method can handle null values in street1, city, or zipcode fields without throwing any exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object with null values for street1, city, and zipcode.
  Act: Call hashCode method on this Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the method completes without an exception and returns an integer.
Validation:
  Clarify that returning an integer even with null values ensures that the hashCode method is robust and null-safe. The significance of this test is to ensure that Address objects with incomplete data do not cause crashes when used in collections.

Scenario 3: Consistency of hash code on successive invocations
Details:
  TestName: hashConsistencyCheck
  Description: Ensures that the hash code returned by the hashCode method remains unchanged across multiple invocations with the same object data.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object with specific non-null values for street1, city, and zipcode.
  Act: Invoke hashCode method on the Address object multiple times.
  Assert: Compare all hash codes returned by these invocations to ensure they are the same.
Validation:
  Clarify that the hash code must remain constant across invocations as long as the object data doesn't change. This test establishes the reliability and stability essential for the correct operation of hash-based collections.

Scenario 4: Different Objects, Different Hash Codes
Details:
  TestName: hashDifferentiationCheck
  Description: Test whether two Address objects with different data produce different hash codes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with different data for all fields (street1, city, zipcode).
  Act: Call hashCode on both objects.
  Assert: Assert that the hash codes are different.
Validation:
  Clarify the necessity for different objects to have distinct hash codes to minimize collisions in hash-based collections. This verification is crucial for optimizing performance and correctness in data structures like HashMap or HashSet.

Scenario 5: Same Data Different Objects Same Hash Code
Details:
  TestName: hashSameDataDifferentObjects
  Description: Assess if two different Address objects initialized with the same data yield the same hash code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with the same data for all fields.
  Act: Invoke hashCode on both objects.
  Assert: Check that the hash codes for both objects are identical.
Validation:
  Clarify that objects with identical data should generate the same hash code, essential for ensuring that such objects are treated equivalently in hash-based collections and algorithms.
