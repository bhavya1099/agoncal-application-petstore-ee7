"""
Scenario 1: Test to verify the hashCode method when all fields are valid
Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithValidFields
  Description: This test aims to verify the hashCode method when the street1, city, and zipcode fields are valid and not null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object with valid street1, city, and zipcode fields.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual hashCode with the expected one.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the hashCode method returns the correct hash value when all fields are valid. This is important to ensure the uniqueness and identification of each Address object.

Scenario 2: Test to verify the hashCode method when some fields are null
Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithNullFields
  Description: This test aims to verify the hashCode method when some of the fields - street1, city, or zipcode - are null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object with some null fields.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual hashCode with the expected one.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the hashCode method can handle null fields and still return a valid hash value. This is crucial for avoiding NullPointerExceptions and ensuring the robustness of the hashCode method.

Scenario 3: Test to verify the hashCode method when all fields are null
Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithAllNullFields
  Description: This test aims to verify the hashCode method when all the fields - street1, city, and zipcode - are null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object with all null fields.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual hashCode with the expected one.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the hashCode method can handle all null fields and still return a valid hash value. This is crucial for avoiding NullPointerExceptions and ensuring the robustness of the hashCode method.

Scenario 4: Test to verify the hashCode method with two identical Address objects
Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithIdenticalObjects
  Description: This test aims to verify the hashCode method when two Address objects have identical field values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with identical field values.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both objects.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the hashCodes of both objects.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the hashCode method returns identical hash values for two objects with identical field values. This is important for maintaining the contract of the hashCode method and ensuring consistent behavior.
