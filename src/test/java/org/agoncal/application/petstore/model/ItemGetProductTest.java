Scenario 1: Retrieve Product from Item with Initialized Product

Details:
  TestName: getProductWithInitializedProduct
  Description: This test checks if the getProduct method correctly returns a non-null Product object that was previously set in an Item object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Product and set it to an Item instance using setProduct.
  Act: Invoke the getProduct method on the Item instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned Product object is the same as the one set earlier.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion checks that the getProduct method returns the exact Product instance that was set, ensuring object retrieval integrity.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: This test verifies that the Item entity correctly handles and retrieves its associated Product, which is crucial for maintaining correct relationships and data consistency in business operations involving Item entities.

Scenario 2: Retrieve Product from Item when No Product is Set

Details:
  TestName: getProductWhenNoProductIsSet
  Description: This test ensures that the getProduct method returns null when no Product has been set to the Item instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Item instance without setting a Product.
  Act: Invoke the getProduct method on the newly created Item instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned Product object is null.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test checks that the getProduct method correctly handles cases where no Product is associated with the Item, returning null as expected.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: It's important for the application to gracefully handle and represent the absence of relationships, ensuring that the system can accurately reflect scenarios where an Item does not have an associated Product.

Scenario 3: Consistency of Product Retrieval from Item

Details:
  TestName: consistentProductRetrievalFromItem
  Description: This test verifies that multiple calls to getProduct on the same Item instance return the same Product object, ensuring consistency across method invocations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Item instance and set a Product instance using setProduct.
  Act: Invoke getProduct multiple times on the same Item instance.
  Assert: Assert that all invocations return the same Product instance.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test ensures that the getProduct method consistently retrieves the same Product instance across multiple calls, which is crucial for ensuring that the method is free of side effects.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Ensuring consistent behavior of getter methods is essential for stable application operations and reliable data handling, particularly when objects are accessed frequently in the application's lifecycle.
