Scenario 1: Validate getProduct Method with Product Set
Details:
  TestName: validateGetProductWithProductSet
  Description: This test is meant to check the getProduct method when a product has been set for the item. It aims to ensure that the method returns the correct product object that was previously set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Item instance and a Product instance. Set the Product instance to the Item using setProduct method.
  Act: Invoke the getProduct method on the Item instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned product against the product that was initially set.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the getProduct method returns the correct product that was set. The expected result is that the returned product and the set product are the same. This test is significant in ensuring that the item's associated product is correctly retrieved.

Scenario 2: Validate getProduct Method with No Product Set
Details:
  TestName: validateGetProductWithNoProductSet
  Description: This test is meant to check the getProduct method when no product has been set for the item. It aims to ensure that the method returns null in such a scenario.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Item instance without setting a product.
  Act: Invoke the getProduct method on the Item instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned product is null.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the getProduct method returns null when no product has been set for the item. The expected result is a null return value. This test is significant in ensuring that the method behaves as expected when there is no associated product.

Scenario 3: Validate getProduct Method with Different Products Set
Details:
  TestName: validateGetProductWithDifferentProductsSet
  Description: This test is meant to check the getProduct method when different products have been set for the item. It aims to ensure that the method always returns the latest product set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Item instance and two Product instances. Set the first Product instance to the Item using setProduct method and then set the second Product instance.
  Act: Invoke the getProduct method on the Item instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned product against the second product that was set.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the getProduct method returns the most recent product that was set. The expected result is that the returned product and the second set product are the same. This test is significant in ensuring that the item's associated product is correctly updated and retrieved.
