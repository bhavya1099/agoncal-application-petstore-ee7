Here are the test scenarios for the `getStreet1` method:
**Scenario 1: Get Street1 with Valid Data**
Details:
TestName: getStreet1ReturnsValidData
Description: This test checks if the `getStreet1` method returns the expected value when the `street1` field is set with a valid string.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the `street1` field to a valid string (e.g., "123 Main St").
Act: Call the `getStreet1` method.
Assert: Use `assertEquals` to verify that the returned value matches the expected value.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the `getStreet1` method returns the correct value when the `street1` field is set with a valid string. This test ensures that the method behaves as expected when the data is valid.
**Scenario 2: Get Street1 with Null Data**
Details:
TestName: getStreet1ReturnsNull
Description: This test checks if the `getStreet1` method returns null when the `street1` field is not set.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the class without setting the `street1` field.
Act: Call the `getStreet1` method.
Assert: Use `assertNull` to verify that the returned value is null.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the `getStreet1` method returns null when the `street1` field is not set. This test ensures that the method behaves as expected when the data is null.
**Scenario 3: Get Street1 with Empty String**
Details:
TestName: getStreet1ReturnsEmptyString
Description: This test checks if the `getStreet1` method returns an empty string when the `street1` field is set to an empty string.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the `street1` field to an empty string.
Act: Call the `getStreet1` method.
Assert: Use `assertEquals` to verify that the returned value is an empty string.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the `getStreet1` method returns an empty string when the `street1` field is set to an empty string. This test ensures that the method behaves as expected when the data is an empty string.
**Scenario 4: Get Street1 with Whitespace**
Details:
TestName: getStreet1ReturnsWhitespace
Description: This test checks if the `getStreet1` method returns a string with whitespace when the `street1` field is set to a string with whitespace.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the `street1` field to a string with whitespace (e.g., " 123 Main St  ").
Act: Call the `getStreet1` method.
Assert: Use `assertEquals` to verify that the returned value matches the expected value with whitespace.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the `getStreet1` method returns a string with whitespace when the `street1` field is set to a string with whitespace. This test ensures that the method behaves as expected when the data contains whitespace.
**Scenario 5: Get Street1 with Special Characters**
Details:
TestName: getStreet1ReturnsSpecialCharacters
Description: This test checks if the `getStreet1` method returns a string with special characters when the `street1` field is set to a string with special characters.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the `street1` field to a string with special characters (e.g., "123 Main St. #123").
Act: Call the `getStreet1` method.
Assert: Use `assertEquals` to verify that the returned value matches the expected value with special characters.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the `getStreet1` method returns a string with special characters when the `street1` field is set to a string with special characters. This test ensures that the method behaves as expected when the data contains special characters.
Note that these test scenarios cover various edge cases, including null, empty string, whitespace, and special characters. The tests ensure that the `getStreet1` method behaves as expected in different scenarios, which is crucial for maintaining the application's behavior and business logic.
