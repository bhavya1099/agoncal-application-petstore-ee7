Scenario 1: Testing getStreet1 method when street1 has a valid value

Details:  
    TestName: getStreet1WithValidValue
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getStreet1 method when street1 has a valid value. It should correctly return the value of street1.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set a valid value for street1 using the setStreet1 method. 
    Act: Invoke the getStreet1 method. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result from the getStreet1 method against the expected result.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getStreet1 method correctly returns the value of street1. This is important as it ensures the method is correctly retrieving the value of street1, which is a crucial part of the Address object.

Scenario 2: Testing getStreet1 method when street1 is null

Details:  
    TestName: getStreet1WithNullValue
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getStreet1 method when street1 is null. It should return null since street1 has not been set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class without setting a value for street1. 
    Act: Invoke the getStreet1 method. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the result of the getStreet1 method is null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getStreet1 method correctly handles the scenario when street1 is null. This is important as it ensures the method is robust and can handle edge cases without crashing the application.

Scenario 3: Testing getStreet1 method after changing the value of street1

Details:  
    TestName: getStreet1AfterValueChange
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getStreet1 method after the value of street1 has been changed. It should return the updated value of street1.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set a value for street1. Then, change the value of street1 using the setStreet1 method.
    Act: Invoke the getStreet1 method. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result from the getStreet1 method against the expected (updated) result.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getStreet1 method correctly returns the updated value of street1. This is important as it ensures the method is effectively retrieving the current value of street1, even after it has been changed.
