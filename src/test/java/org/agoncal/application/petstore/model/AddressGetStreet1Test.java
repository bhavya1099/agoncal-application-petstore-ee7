"""
  Scenario 1: Test that getStreet1 returns the correct value after setting it.

  Details:  
    TestName: fetchStreet1AfterSetting.
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getter method getStreet1() after setting a value to the street1 field using the setter method. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class. Set a value to the street1 field using the setStreet1() method.
    Act: Invoke the getStreet1() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the getStreet1() method returns the same value that was set to the street1 field.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify the correct functionality of the getter method getStreet1(). The expected result is the same value that was set to the street1 field. This test is significant as it ensures that the getter method is accurately retrieving the field's value.

  Scenario 2: Test that getStreet1 returns null when the street1 field is not set.

  Details:  
    TestName: fetchStreet1WithoutSetting.
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getStreet1() method when no value has been set to the street1 field. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class. Do not set a value to the street1 field.
    Act: Invoke the getStreet1() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the getStreet1() method returns null.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that the getStreet1() method returns null when no value has been set to the street1 field. The expected result is null. This test is significant as it ensures that the getter method is accurately retrieving the field's value, even when it has not been set.
