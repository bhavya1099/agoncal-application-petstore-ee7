Scenario 1: Testing getStreet1 method when street1 has a valid value

Details:
    TestName: getStreet1WithValidValue
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getStreet1 method when street1 has a valid value. It should correctly return the value of street1.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set a valid value for street1 using the setStreet1 method.
    Act: Invoke the getStreet1 method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result from the getStreet1 method against the expected result (which is the value set for street1).
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getStreet1 method correctly returns the value of street1. This is significant as it ensures the correct retrieval of street1 value from the Address object.

Scenario 2: Testing getStreet1 method when street1 is null

Details:
    TestName: getStreet1WithNullValue
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getStreet1 method when street1 is null. It should return null since street1 has no value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class without setting a value for street1.
    Act: Invoke the getStreet1 method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result from the getStreet1 method (which should be null) against the expected result (null).
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getStreet1 method correctly handles the situation when street1 is null. This is significant as it ensures the method can handle null values and does not throw unexpected exceptions.

Scenario 3: Testing getStreet1 method after changing the value of street1

Details:
    TestName: getStreet1AfterValueChange
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getStreet1 method after changing the value of street1. It should correctly return the updated value of street1.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set a value for street1. Then change the value of street1 using the setStreet1 method.
    Act: Invoke the getStreet1 method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result from the getStreet1 method against the expected result (which is the updated value of street1).
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getStreet1 method correctly returns the updated value of street1. This is significant as it ensures the method reflects changes made to the street1 value.

Scenario 4: Testing getStreet1 method for different Address objects

Details:
    TestName: getStreet1ForDifferentObjects
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getStreet1 method for different Address objects. Each Address object should have its own street1 value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create multiple instances of the Address class and set different values for street1 for each instance.
    Act: Invoke the getStreet1 method for each Address object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result from the getStreet1 method against the expected result for each Address object.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getStreet1 method correctly returns the street1 value for each Address object. This is significant as it ensures the correct retrieval of street1 value from different Address objects.
