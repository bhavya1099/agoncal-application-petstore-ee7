Scenario 1: Testing getStreet1 method when street1 has a valid value

Details:
  TestName: getStreet1WithValidValue
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getStreet1 method when street1 has a valid value. It should correctly return the value of street1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set a valid value for street1 using the setStreet1 method.
  Act: Invoke the getStreet1 method on the created Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome, which should be the value set for street1.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the getStreet1 method correctly returns the value of street1. The test is significant as it ensures that the getter method for street1 is working as expected.

Scenario 2: Testing getStreet1 method when street1 is null

Details:
  TestName: getStreet1WithNullValue
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getStreet1 method when street1 is null. It should return null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object without setting a value for street1.
  Act: Invoke the getStreet1 method on the created Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome, which should be null.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the getStreet1 method correctly handles null values for street1. The test is significant as it ensures that the getter method for street1 can handle null values without throwing an exception.

Scenario 3: Testing getStreet1 method when street1 has an empty string

Details:
  TestName: getStreet1WithEmptyString
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getStreet1 method when street1 is an empty string. It should return an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set an empty string for street1 using the setStreet1 method.
  Act: Invoke the getStreet1 method on the created Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome, which should be an empty string.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the getStreet1 method correctly handles empty strings for street1. The test is significant as it ensures that the getter method for street1 can handle empty strings without returning incorrect values.
