Scenario 1: Testing getStreet1 method when street1 has a valid value

Details:  
  TestName: getStreet1WithValidValue
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getStreet1 method when street1 has a valid value. It should correctly return the value of street1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set a valid value for street1 using the setStreet1 method.
  Act: Invoke the getStreet1 method on the created Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result from the getStreet1 method against the expected value of street1.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getStreet1 method correctly returns the value of street1 when it has a valid value. This test is significant as it confirms the basic functionality of the getStreet1 method in the Address class.

Scenario 2: Testing getStreet1 method when street1 is null

Details:  
  TestName: getStreet1WithNullValue
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getStreet1 method when street1 is null. It should return null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object without setting a value for street1.
  Act: Invoke the getStreet1 method on the created Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the result from the getStreet1 method is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getStreet1 method correctly handles the scenario when street1 is null. This test is significant as it tests the robustness of the getStreet1 method in handling null values.

Scenario 3: Testing getStreet1 method when street1 is an empty string

Details:  
  TestName: getStreet1WithEmptyValue
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getStreet1 method when street1 is an empty string. It should return an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set street1 as an empty string using the setStreet1 method.
  Act: Invoke the getStreet1 method on the created Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the result from the getStreet1 method is an empty string.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getStreet1 method correctly handles the scenario when street1 is an empty string. This test is significant as it tests the robustness of the getStreet1 method in handling edge cases.
