ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getStreet1_de5cedc37e

Scenario 1: Test to ensure getStreet1() returns the correct street1 value.

Details:
  TestName: testGetStreet1ReturnsCorrectValue
  Description: This test is to ensure that the getStreet1() method correctly fetches the value of street1 from the Address entity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address entity and set a known value for street1 using the setStreet1() method.
  Act: Invoke the getStreet1() method on the Address instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against the known value set for street1.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getStreet1() method correctly fetches the value of street1. The expected result is the known value set for street1 as the getStreet1() method should simply return the current value of street1. This test is significant as it ensures the basic functionality of the getter method for street1 in the Address entity.

Scenario 2: Test to check if getStreet1() returns null when street1 is not set.

Details:
  TestName: testGetStreet1ReturnsNullWhenNotSet
  Description: This test is to check if the getStreet1() method returns null when the value of street1 has not been set in the Address entity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address entity without setting a value for street1.
  Act: Invoke the getStreet1() method on the Address instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getStreet1() method returns null when the value of street1 has not been set. The expected result is null as no value has been set for street1. This test is significant as it checks the correct behavior of the getStreet1() method when no value has been set for street1.

Scenario 3: Test to check if getStreet1() returns an empty string when street1 is set to an empty string.

Details:
  TestName: testGetStreet1ReturnsEmptyStringWhenSetToEmpty
  Description: This test is to check if the getStreet1() method returns an empty string when the value of street1 has been set to an empty string in the Address entity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address entity and set the value of street1 to an empty string using the setStreet1() method.
  Act: Invoke the getStreet1() method on the Address instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is an empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getStreet1() method returns an empty string when the value of street1 has been set to an empty string. The expected result is an empty string as that is the value set for street1. This test is significant as it checks the correct behavior of the getStreet1() method when the value of street1 has been set to an empty string.
