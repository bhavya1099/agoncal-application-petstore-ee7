"""
Scenario 1: Validate getStreet1 method when street1 has a valid string value
Details:  
  TestName: validateGetStreet1WithValidStringValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getStreet1 method correctly returns the value of street1 when it is set to a valid string.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of Address is created with street1 set to a valid string "123 Main St".
  Act: The getStreet1 method is invoked on the Address instance.
  Assert: The returned value is compared with the expected value "123 Main St" using JUnit assertions.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getStreet1 method correctly returns the value of street1. This is important to ensure that the Address entity correctly stores and retrieves the street1 value.

Scenario 2: Validate getStreet1 method when street1 is not set
Details:  
  TestName: validateGetStreet1WhenNotSet
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getStreet1 method correctly returns null when the street1 value is not set.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of Address is created without setting a value for street1.
  Act: The getStreet1 method is invoked on the Address instance.
  Assert: The returned value is compared with the expected value null using JUnit assertions.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getStreet1 method correctly returns null when street1 is not set. This is important to ensure that the Address entity correctly handles cases where not all fields are set.

Scenario 3: Validate getStreet1 method when street1 is set to an empty string
Details:  
  TestName: validateGetStreet1WithEmptyString
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getStreet1 method correctly returns an empty string when street1 is set to "".
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of Address is created with street1 set to "".
  Act: The getStreet1 method is invoked on the Address instance.
  Assert: The returned value is compared with the expected value "" using JUnit assertions.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getStreet1 method correctly returns an empty string when street1 is set to "". This is important to ensure that the Address entity correctly handles cases where street1 is an empty string.
