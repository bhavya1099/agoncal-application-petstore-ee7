```
Scenario 1: Valid street1 retrieval
Details:
  TestName: retrieveValidStreet1
  Description: This test checks if the getStreet1 method correctly retrieves the street1 value that was previously set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address and set the street1 using setStreet1 method with a valid string "123 Elm St".
  Act: Call the getStreet1 method to retrieve the value.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value from getStreet1 equals "123 Elm St".
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: The assertion verifies that the getStreet1 method returns the exact string that was set, confirming correct getter functionality.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Ensuring that the street address is correctly retrieved allows for accurate use in applications where the address might determine delivery zones, billing information, or user location identification.
Scenario 2: Null street1 retrieval
Details:
  TestName: retrieveNullStreet1
  Description: This test checks if the getStreet1 method correctly handles and returns a null value if street1 was not set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address without setting street1.
  Act: Call the getStreet1 method to retrieve the value.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value from getStreet1 is null.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: The assertion verifies that getStreet1 returns null when no value has been set, ensuring the method's robustness in handling uninitialized fields.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Testing for null handling is crucial as it prevents the application from potential crashes due to null pointer exceptions, enhancing the reliability and stability of the system.
Scenario 3: Empty string street1 retrieval
Details:
  TestName: retrieveEmptyStreet1
  Description: This test checks if the getStreet1 method can handle and return an empty string correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address and set the street1 to an empty string "" using setStreet1.
  Act: Call the getStreet1 method to retrieve the value.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value from getStreet1 is an empty string "".
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: The assertion checks that getStreet1 effectively returns an empty string when it has been set as such, confirming that the getter handles edge cases appropriately.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Ensuring the method handles empty strings correctly is important for scenarios where the street address might be optional or not provided, allowing the application to maintain operational integrity without erroneous data input.
