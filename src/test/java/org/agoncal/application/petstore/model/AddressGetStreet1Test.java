Scenario 1: Testing getStreet1 method when street1 has a valid value

Details:
  TestName: getStreet1WithValidValue
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getStreet1 method when street1 has a valid value. It should correctly return the value of street1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set a valid value for street1 using the setStreet1 method.
  Act: Invoke the getStreet1 method on the created Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result from the getStreet1 method against the expected result (which is the value set for street1).
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getStreet1 method correctly returns the value of street1 when it has a valid value. The test is significant as it validates the basic functionality of the getStreet1 method.

Scenario 2: Testing getStreet1 method when street1 is null

Details:
  TestName: getStreet1WhenNull
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getStreet1 method when street1 is null. It should return null as street1 doesn't have a value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object without setting a value for street1.
  Act: Invoke the getStreet1 method on the created Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result from the getStreet1 method against the expected result (which is null).
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getStreet1 method correctly handles the situation when street1 is null. The test is significant as it checks the robustness of the getStreet1 method in handling null values.

Scenario 3: Testing getStreet1 method after changing the value of street1

Details:
  TestName: getStreet1AfterValueChange
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getStreet1 method after the value of street1 has been changed. The method should return the latest value of street1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set a value for street1. Then change the value of street1 using the setStreet1 method.
  Act: Invoke the getStreet1 method on the created Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result from the getStreet1 method against the expected result (which is the latest value set for street1).
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getStreet1 method correctly returns the latest value of street1 after it has been changed. The test is significant as it checks the correctness of the getStreet1 method in reflecting changes to street1.
