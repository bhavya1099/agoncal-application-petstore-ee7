Here are the generated test scenarios for the `getStreet1` method:
**Scenario 1: Get Street1 When Value is Null**
Details:
TestName: testGetStreet1WhenValueIsNull
Description: Test that the method returns null when the `street1` field is null.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the class with `street1` set to null.
Act: Call the `getStreet1` method.
Assert: Use `assertNull` to verify that the returned value is null.
Validation: This test ensures that the method behaves correctly when the `street1` field is uninitialized or has not been set. This is an important edge case, as it ensures that the method does not return a non-null value that could lead to unexpected behavior downstream.
**Scenario 2: Get Street1 When Value is Empty String**
Details:
TestName: testGetStreet1WhenValueIsEmptyString
Description: Test that the method returns an empty string when the `street1` field is set to an empty string.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the class with `street1` set to an empty string.
Act: Call the `getStreet1` method.
Assert: Use `assertEquals` to verify that the returned value is an empty string.
Validation: This test ensures that the method behaves correctly when the `street1` field is set to an empty string. This is an important edge case, as it ensures that the method does not return a non-empty value that could lead to unexpected behavior downstream.
**Scenario 3: Get Street1 When Value is Non-Empty String**
Details:
TestName: testGetStreet1WhenValueIsNonEmptyString
Description: Test that the method returns the expected value when the `street1` field is set to a non-empty string.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the class with `street1` set to a non-empty string (e.g. "123 Main St").
Act: Call the `getStreet1` method.
Assert: Use `assertEquals` to verify that the returned value matches the expected value.
Validation: This test ensures that the method behaves correctly when the `street1` field is set to a valid value. This is a basic test to ensure that the method returns the expected value.
**Scenario 4: Get Street1 When Object is Newly Created**
Details:
TestName: testGetStreet1WhenObjectIsNewlyCreated
Description: Test that the method returns null when the object is newly created and no value has been set for `street1`.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a new instance of the class without setting any values.
Act: Call the `getStreet1` method.
Assert: Use `assertNull` to verify that the returned value is null.
Validation: This test ensures that the method behaves correctly when the object is newly created and no value has been set for `street1`. This is an important edge case, as it ensures that the method does not return a non-null value that could lead to unexpected behavior downstream.
**Scenario 5: Get Street1 When Object is Serialized and Deserialized**
Details:
TestName: testGetStreet1WhenObjectIsSerializedAndDeserialized
Description: Test that the method returns the expected value when the object is serialized and deserialized.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the class with `street1` set to a non-empty string. Serialize the object, then deserialize it.
Act: Call the `getStreet1` method on the deserialized object.
Assert: Use `assertEquals` to verify that the returned value matches the expected value.
Validation: This test ensures that the method behaves correctly when the object is serialized and deserialized. This is an important test to ensure that the method works correctly in scenarios where the object is persisted or transmitted over a network.
