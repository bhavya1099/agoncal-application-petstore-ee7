Based on the provided information and the getStreet1() method, here are several test scenarios:

Scenario 1: Get Street1 When Value Is Set

Details:
  TestName: getStreet1WhenValueIsSet
  Description: This test verifies that the getStreet1() method correctly returns the value of street1 when it has been set.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Address object and set a value for street1 using the setStreet1 method.
  Act: Call the getStreet1() method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the value that was set.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the getter method correctly retrieves the value of the private street1 field. It's important to verify this basic functionality as it's fundamental to the Address class's operation.

Scenario 2: Get Street1 When Value Is Null

Details:
  TestName: getStreet1WhenValueIsNull
  Description: This test checks the behavior of getStreet1() when the street1 field has not been set and remains null.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Address object without setting any value for street1.
  Act: Call the getStreet1() method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is null.

Validation:
  This test confirms that the getter method correctly handles the case when the street1 field is null. It's crucial to ensure that the method doesn't throw an exception or return an unexpected value in this scenario.

Scenario 3: Get Street1 After Multiple Sets

Details:
  TestName: getStreet1AfterMultipleSets
  Description: This test verifies that getStreet1() returns the most recent value set for street1 after multiple setStreet1() calls.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Address object and set street1 multiple times using setStreet1().
  Act: Call the getStreet1() method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the last value that was set.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the getter method always returns the most up-to-date value of the street1 field. It's important to verify this behavior to ensure data consistency within the Address object.

Scenario 4: Get Street1 With Empty String

Details:
  TestName: getStreet1WithEmptyString
  Description: This test checks the behavior of getStreet1() when street1 is set to an empty string.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Address object and set street1 to an empty string using setStreet1("").
  Act: Call the getStreet1() method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is an empty string and not null.

Validation:
  This test confirms that the getter method correctly handles empty strings, distinguishing them from null values. This is important for data integrity and to prevent potential null pointer exceptions in code that uses this method.

Scenario 5: Get Street1 After Setting Other Address Fields

Details:
  TestName: getStreet1AfterSettingOtherFields
  Description: This test verifies that getStreet1() returns the correct value even after other fields of the Address object have been modified.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Address object, set street1, and then set values for other fields like street2, city, state, etc.
  Act: Call the getStreet1() method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value still matches the originally set street1 value.

Validation:
  This test ensures that modifications to other fields of the Address object do not inadvertently affect the street1 field. It's crucial to verify this isolation to maintain data integrity within the Address object.

These scenarios cover various aspects of the getStreet1() method, including normal operation, edge cases, and potential interactions with other parts of the Address class.
