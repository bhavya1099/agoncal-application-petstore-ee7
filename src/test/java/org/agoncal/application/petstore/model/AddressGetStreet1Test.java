```
Scenario 1: Valid street1 retrieval

Details:
  TestName: retrieveValidStreet1
  Description: Validates that the getStreet1 method returns correct street name when a valid street name is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address and set a valid street name using `setStreet1("123 Elm St.")`.
  Act: Call `getStreet1()` to retrieve the street name.
  Assert: Assert that the returned street name is equal to "123 Elm St.".
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the getStreet1 method correctly returns the street name previously set by setStreet1, confirming the correctness of getter implementation. This is significant for confirming data integrity between sets and gets within the Address class.

Scenario 2: Null street1 retrieval

Details:
  TestName: retrieveNullStreet1
  Description: Validates that the getStreet1 method returns null when street1 has never been initialized or explicitly set to null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address without setting the street1 value.
  Act: Call `getStreet1()` to retrieve the street name.
  Assert: Assert that the returned street name is null.
Validation:
  This assertion checks the method's ability to return a null value if street1 is not set, ensuring the method's robustness in handling uninitialized fields. This test is significant as it validates the class's default state behavior and null safety.

Scenario 3: Empty string street1 retrieval

Details:
  TestName: retrieveEmptyStreet1
  Description: Checks the behavior of the getStreet1 method when the street name is set to an empty string, which is a valid edge case.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address and use `setStreet1("")` to set the street name as an empty string.
  Act: Call `getStreet1()` to retrieve the street name.
  Assert: Assert that the returned street name is an empty string "".
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the getStreet1 method properly retrieves the value set, even if it is an empty string. This test highlights the method's reliability in handling edge case inputs and its adherence to expected functionality across varied inputs.

Scenario 4: Repeated set and get operations

Details:
  TestName: testRepeatedSetAndGetStreet1
  Description: Verifies that the getStreet1 method consistently returns the last set value among multiple set operations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address, set the street1 multiple times with different values: `setStreet1("123 Elm St.")`, then `setStreet1("456 Oak St.")`.
  Act: Call `getStreet1()` to retrieve the current street name.
  Assert: Assert that the returned street name is "456 Oak St.".
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getStreet1 method responds correctly to the most recent set value, reflecting typical use cases where an object's field may be updated multiple times. It is critical for maintaining data accuracy and integrity across object lifecycle changes.
