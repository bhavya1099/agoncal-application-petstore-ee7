Based on the provided information and the method getStreet1(), here are some test scenarios:
Scenario 1: Get Street1 with Valid Data
Details:
  TestName: getStreet1WithValidData
  Description: Test the getStreet1() method when a valid street1 value is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set a valid street1 value.
  Act: Call the getStreet1() method.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the set street1 value.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getStreet1() method correctly returns the street1 value when it has been properly set. It validates the basic functionality of the getter method.
Scenario 2: Get Street1 with Null Value
Details:
  TestName: getStreet1WithNullValue
  Description: Test the getStreet1() method when the street1 value is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object without setting a street1 value (leaving it null).
  Act: Call the getStreet1() method.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  This test checks the behavior of getStreet1() when the street1 field is null. It ensures that the method handles null values correctly and doesn't throw any unexpected exceptions.
Scenario 3: Get Street1 with Empty String
Details:
  TestName: getStreet1WithEmptyString
  Description: Test the getStreet1() method when the street1 value is an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set the street1 value to an empty string.
  Act: Call the getStreet1() method.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is an empty string.
Validation:
  This test ensures that getStreet1() correctly handles and returns an empty string when the street1 field is set to one. It's important to differentiate between null and empty string behaviors.
Scenario 4: Get Street1 with Maximum Length String
Details:
  TestName: getStreet1WithMaxLengthString
  Description: Test the getStreet1() method when the street1 value is set to its maximum allowed length.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set the street1 value to a string of maximum allowed length (assuming there's a @Size constraint).
  Act: Call the getStreet1() method.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the set maximum length string.
Validation:
  This test checks if getStreet1() correctly handles and returns a string of maximum allowed length. It ensures that no truncation or alteration occurs for boundary values.
Note: These scenarios assume that the street1 field is directly accessible or that there's a corresponding setter method, which isn't explicitly mentioned in the provided information. If a setter method doesn't exist, the "Arrange" step in these scenarios would need to be adjusted accordingly, possibly using reflection or constructor injection if available.
