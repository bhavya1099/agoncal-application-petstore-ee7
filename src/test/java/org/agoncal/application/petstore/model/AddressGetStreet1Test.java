**Scenario 1: Test getStreet1 with default null value**

Details:
TestName: getStreet1WithDefaultValue
Description: This test checks if the getStreet1 method correctly returns a null value when the street1 field has not been set. Since street1 defaults to null, the method should accurately reflect this.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class without setting the street1 field.
Act: Invoke the getStreet1 method on the created instance.
Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.
Validation:
The assertion validates that the method returns the default state of street1. This ensures the object's default state integrity and that getter methods are accessing the correct class fields.

**Scenario 2: Test getStreet1 after setting a non-null value**

Details:
TestName: getStreet1AfterSettingValue
Description: This test ensures that the getStreet1 method returns the correct string value that was set using setStreet1. It checks the method's ability to accurately retrieve the property after modification.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set the street1 field to "123 Baker Street".
Act: Invoke the getStreet1 method on the instance.
Assert: Assert that the returned value equals "123 Baker Street".
Validation:
The assertion confirms that the getStreet1 method retrieves the current value of the street1 field after it has been explicitly set. This test validates the integrability and correctness of both get and set methods for the street1 property.

**Scenario 3: Test getStreet1 for thread safety**

Details:
TestName: getStreet1ThreadSafetyCheck
Description: This test checks the thread safety of the getStreet1 method. It runs multiple threads that set and get the street1 value, ensuring data integrity is maintained in a multi-threaded environment.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class. Run multiple threads where each thread sets a unique value to street1 and then reads it back using getStreet1.
Act: Start the threads and wait for all of them to complete execution.
Assert: Verify that all threads return the correct value that was set individually per thread.
Validation:
This test confirms whether getStreet1 retrieves correct values in a concurrent setting, an essential aspect for multi-threaded applications to prevent data corruption.

These scenarios cover various aspects of using the getStreet1 method from the initial default behavior to interactions after modifications and its performance in a concurrent environment.
