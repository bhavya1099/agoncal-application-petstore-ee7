```
Scenario 1: Validate getStreet1 returns correct street1 value when street1 is set
Details:
  TestName: testGetStreet1WithValidStreet1
  Description: This test validates that the getStreet1 method returns the correct street1 value when a valid street1 is set in the Address entity.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address object and set a valid street1 value.
    Act: Call getStreet1 method on the Address object.
    Assert: Ensure that the returned street1 value matches the originally set street1 value.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the getStreet1 method correctly retrieves the street1 value from the Address entity, confirming the getter functionality.

Scenario 2: Validate getStreet1 returns null when street1 is not set
Details:
  TestName: testGetStreet1WithNullStreet1
  Description: This test ensures that the getStreet1 method returns null when no street1 value is set in the Address entity.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address object without setting a street1 value.
    Act: Call getStreet1 method on the Address object.
    Assert: Verify that the returned street1 value is null.
  Validation:
    This test is crucial to check the getter behavior when the street1 field is not initialized, ensuring that the method handles null values appropriately.

Scenario 3: Validate getStreet1 handles empty street1 value
Details:
  TestName: testGetStreet1WithEmptyStreet1
  Description: This test validates that the getStreet1 method handles an empty street1 value correctly in the Address entity.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address object and set an empty street1 value.
    Act: Call getStreet1 method on the Address object.
    Assert: Confirm that the returned street1 value is empty as expected.
  Validation:
    This scenario tests the getter behavior with an empty street1 value, ensuring proper handling of such edge cases.

Scenario 4: Validate getStreet1 consistency with equals method comparison
Details:
  TestName: testGetStreet1ConsistencyWithEquals
  Description: This test ensures that the getStreet1 method consistency aligns with the equals method comparison in the Address entity.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two Address objects with the same street1 value.
    Act: Call getStreet1 method on both objects and compare the returned values.
    Assert: Validate that the street1 values retrieved are equal, confirming consistency with the equals method.
  Validation:
    This test guarantees that the getStreet1 method behaves consistently with the equals method, maintaining integrity in object comparison logic.

Scenario 5: Validate getStreet1 hash code consistency
Details:
  TestName: testGetStreet1HashCodeConsistency
  Description: This test ensures that the getStreet1 method maintains hash code consistency in the Address entity.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address object and retrieve the hash code from the street1 value.
    Act: Call getStreet1 method again on the same object and retrieve the hash code once more.
    Assert: Verify that the hash codes obtained for street1 are consistent.
  Validation:
    This scenario checks the hash code consistency of the getStreet1 method, crucial for object comparison and hashing operations.
