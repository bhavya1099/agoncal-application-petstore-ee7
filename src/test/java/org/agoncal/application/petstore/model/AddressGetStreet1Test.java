Scenario 1: Testing getStreet1 method when street1 has a valid value

Details:
  TestName: getStreet1WithValidValue
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getStreet1 method when street1 has a valid value. It should correctly return the value of street1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set a valid value for street1 using the setStreet1 method.
  Act: Invoke the getStreet1 method on the created Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome, which should be the value set for street1.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the getStreet1 method correctly returns the value of street1. The test is significant as it ensures that the getter method for street1 is working as expected.

Scenario 2: Testing getStreet1 method when street1 is null

Details:
  TestName: getStreet1WithNullValue
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getStreet1 method when street1 is null. It should return null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object without setting a value for street1.
  Act: Invoke the getStreet1 method on the created Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the getStreet1 method correctly handles null values. The test is significant as it checks that the method can handle edge cases where street1 is not set.

Scenario 3: Testing getStreet1 method after changing the value of street1

Details:
  TestName: getStreet1AfterValueChange
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getStreet1 method after the value of street1 has been changed. It should return the new value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set a value for street1. Then change this value by calling setStreet1 again with a different value.
  Act: Invoke the getStreet1 method on the created Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome, which should be the new value set for street1.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the getStreet1 method correctly returns the updated value of street1. This test is important as it ensures that the getter method reflects changes made to the value of street1.
