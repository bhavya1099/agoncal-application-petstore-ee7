Scenario 1: Testing getStreet1 method when street1 has a valid value

Details:
  TestName: getStreet1WithValidValue
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getStreet1 method when street1 has a valid value. It should correctly return the value of street1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set a valid value for street1 using the setStreet1 method.
  Act: Invoke the getStreet1 method on the created Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result from the getStreet1 method against the expected value of street1.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getStreet1 method correctly returns the value of street1 when it has a valid value. This test is significant to ensure that the method is functioning as expected and correctly retrieving the value of street1.

Scenario 2: Testing getStreet1 method when street1 is null

Details:
  TestName: getStreet1WithNullValue
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getStreet1 method when street1 is null. It should return null as the value of street1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object without setting a value for street1.
  Act: Invoke the getStreet1 method on the created Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the result from the getStreet1 method is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getStreet1 method correctly handles the scenario where street1 is null and returns null as expected. This test is significant to ensure that the method can handle null values and does not result in unexpected behavior or exceptions.

Scenario 3: Testing getStreet1 method after changing the value of street1

Details:
  TestName: getStreet1AfterValueChange
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getStreet1 method after changing the value of street1. It should return the updated value of street1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set a value for street1. Then change the value of street1 using the setStreet1 method.
  Act: Invoke the getStreet1 method on the created Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result from the getStreet1 method against the updated value of street1.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getStreet1 method correctly returns the updated value of street1 after it has been changed. This test is significant to ensure that the method is accurately reflecting changes to the value of street1.
