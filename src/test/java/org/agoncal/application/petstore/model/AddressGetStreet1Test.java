Based on the provided method and class information, here are several test scenarios for the `getStreet1()` method:
Scenario 1: Get Street1 When Value Is Set
Details:
  TestName: getStreet1WhenValueIsSet
  Description: Verify that the getStreet1() method returns the correct value when street1 is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set a value for street1 using a setter method (assuming it exists).
  Act: Call the getStreet1() method.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the set value.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getter method correctly returns the value of the private street1 field. It's important to verify that the encapsulation is working as expected, allowing access to the private field through the public getter method.
Scenario 2: Get Street1 When Value Is Null
Details:
  TestName: getStreet1WhenValueIsNull
  Description: Verify that the getStreet1() method returns null when street1 is not set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the class without setting a value for street1.
  Act: Call the getStreet1() method.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  This test checks the default behavior of the getter when the field hasn't been initialized. It's important to confirm that the method handles null values correctly, which is the initial state of the street1 field as per the provided information.
Scenario 3: Get Street1 After Setting Empty String
Details:
  TestName: getStreet1AfterSettingEmptyString
  Description: Verify that the getStreet1() method returns an empty string when street1 is set to an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set street1 to an empty string using a setter method (assuming it exists).
  Act: Call the getStreet1() method.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is an empty string.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getter method correctly handles and returns empty strings. It's important to verify that the method doesn't treat empty strings as null or modify them in any way.
Scenario 4: Get Street1 With Maximum Length String
Details:
  TestName: getStreet1WithMaximumLengthString
  Description: Verify that the getStreet1() method correctly returns a string of maximum allowed length.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set street1 to a string of maximum allowed length (based on @Size annotation if present).
  Act: Call the getStreet1() method.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the set maximum length string.
Validation:
  This test checks if the getter method correctly handles strings at the upper boundary of allowed length. It's important to ensure that no truncation or modification occurs for maximum length inputs.
Scenario 5: Get Street1 Consistency Across Multiple Calls
Details:
  TestName: getStreet1ConsistencyAcrossMultipleCalls
  Description: Verify that multiple calls to getStreet1() return the same value without any side effects.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set a value for street1.
  Act: Call the getStreet1() method multiple times.
  Assert: Verify that all calls return the same value.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getter method is idempotent and doesn't have any unexpected side effects. It's crucial for maintaining the integrity of the object's state across multiple accesses.
These scenarios cover various aspects of the getStreet1() method, including normal operation, edge cases, and potential error conditions, based on the provided class information and common getter method behaviors.
