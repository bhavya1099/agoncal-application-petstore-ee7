Based on the provided information and the method `getStreet1()`, here are several test scenarios for the Address entity:
Scenario 1: Retrieve Street1 Value Successfully
Details:
  TestName: retrieveStreet1Value()
  Description: Verify that the getStreet1() method correctly returns the street1 value when it has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set a value for street1 using the setStreet1() method.
  Act: Call the getStreet1() method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the value that was set.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getStreet1() method correctly retrieves the street1 value that has been stored in the Address object. It's crucial for maintaining the integrity of address information in the application.
Scenario 2: Retrieve Null Street1 Value
Details:
  TestName: retrieveNullStreet1Value()
  Description: Verify that the getStreet1() method returns null when the street1 value has not been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Address object without setting any values.
  Act: Call the getStreet1() method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  This test checks the behavior of getStreet1() when no street1 value has been set. It's important to ensure that the method handles uninitialized values correctly to prevent null pointer exceptions in the application logic.
Scenario 3: Retrieve Street1 After Multiple Updates
Details:
  TestName: retrieveStreet1AfterMultipleUpdates()
  Description: Verify that the getStreet1() method returns the most recent value after multiple updates to street1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set the street1 value multiple times using setStreet1().
  Act: Call the getStreet1() method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the last value that was set.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getStreet1() method always returns the most up-to-date value, even after multiple updates. It's crucial for maintaining data consistency, especially in scenarios where address information might be updated frequently.
Scenario 4: Verify Street1 Independence from Other Fields
Details:
  TestName: verifyStreet1IndependenceFromOtherFields()
  Description: Ensure that getStreet1() returns the correct value regardless of changes to other address fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object, set a value for street1, and then set values for other fields like street2, city, state, etc.
  Act: Call the getStreet1() method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the initially set street1 value, unaffected by other field changes.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the getStreet1() method is independent of other address fields. It's important to ensure that modifications to other parts of the Address object do not inadvertently affect the street1 value, maintaining data integrity across all address components.
Scenario 5: Verify Street1 Value in toString() Output
Details:
  TestName: verifyStreet1ValueInToString()
  Description: Ensure that the street1 value returned by getStreet1() is correctly represented in the toString() output.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set a value for street1.
  Act: Call getStreet1() and toString() methods on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the street1 value from getStreet1() is present in the string returned by toString().
Validation:
  This test ensures consistency between the getStreet1() method and the object's string representation. It's important for debugging and logging purposes, ensuring that the street1 value is correctly included when the Address object is converted to a string.
These scenarios cover various aspects of the getStreet1() method, including normal operation, edge cases, and its interaction with other parts of the Address entity.
