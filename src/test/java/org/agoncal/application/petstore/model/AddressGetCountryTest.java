Based on the provided information and the method `getCountry()` in the Address entity, here are some test scenarios:
```
Scenario 1: Get Country When Set
Details:
  TestName: getCountryWhenSet
  Description: Verify that the getCountry method returns the correct Country object when it has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and a Country object. Set the Country object to the Address using the setCountry method.
  Act: Call the getCountry method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned Country object is the same as the one that was set.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getCountry method correctly returns the Country object that was previously set. It validates the basic functionality of the getter method and confirms that the Address entity maintains the association with the Country entity as expected.
Scenario 2: Get Country When Not Set
Details:
  TestName: getCountryWhenNotSet
  Description: Verify that the getCountry method returns null when no Country has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Address object without setting a Country.
  Act: Call the getCountry method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  This test checks the behavior of the getCountry method when no Country has been associated with the Address. It's important to verify that the method handles this case gracefully by returning null, which is the expected behavior for uninitialized reference types in Java.
Scenario 3: Get Country After Setting to Null
Details:
  TestName: getCountryAfterSettingToNull
  Description: Verify that the getCountry method returns null after explicitly setting the country to null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object, set its Country to null using the setCountry method.
  Act: Call the getCountry method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getCountry method correctly handles the case where the Country has been explicitly set to null. It's important to verify that the method reflects this state change and returns null as expected, maintaining consistency with the current state of the Address object.
Scenario 4: Get Country Multiple Times
Details:
  TestName: getCountryMultipleTimes
  Description: Verify that multiple calls to getCountry return the same Country object without changing it.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and a Country object. Set the Country object to the Address using the setCountry method.
  Act: Call the getCountry method multiple times on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that all calls return the same Country object and that the object hasn't been modified.
Validation:
  This test ensures that repeated calls to getCountry are consistent and do not inadvertently modify the returned Country object. It validates the stability and immutability of the getter method, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the Address-Country relationship.
```
These scenarios cover the main aspects of the `getCountry()` method, including normal operation, edge cases (null values), and consistency checks. They align with the provided information about the Address entity and its available methods.
