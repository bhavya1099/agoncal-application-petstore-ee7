```
Scenario 1: Valid Country Retrieval

Details:
  TestName: getCountryWithValidData
  Description: Test to ensure that the getCountry method correctly retrieves the country associated with the address when a valid country is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address and set a valid Country object using setCountry.
  Act: Call getCountry method on the Address instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned Country object is the same as the one set.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion checks that the getCountry method returns the exact Country object that was previously set.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: This test is crucial to ensure that the Address entity correctly handles and retrieves country information, which is vital for correct geographical categorization in business logic.

Scenario 2: Null Country Retrieval

Details:
  TestName: getCountryWithNullValue
  Description: Test to verify if the getCountry method can handle and return a null value gracefully when no country has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address without setting a Country.
  Act: Call getCountry method on the Address instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned Country object is null.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion checks that the getCountry method returns null when no country has been set, indicating robust handling of null values.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: This test is important to confirm that the application can handle cases where an address might not have a country associated with it without causing errors or unexpected behavior.

Scenario 3: Consistency in Country Retrieval

Details:
  TestName: getCountryConsistencyCheck
  Description: Test to check if multiple calls to getCountry return the same Country object, ensuring data consistency.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address and set a specific Country object.
  Act: Call getCountry method multiple times on the same Address instance.
  Assert: Assert that all calls to getCountry return the same Country object.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion ensures that the getCountry method consistently retrieves the same Country object across multiple invocations.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensuring consistency in retrieval of data from entity objects is crucial for maintaining state integrity across different parts of the application where the same data might be accessed repeatedly.

Scenario 4: Country Retrieval After Country Update

Details:
  TestName: getCountryAfterUpdate
  Description: Verify that after updating the Country of an Address, the getCountry method reflects this change correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address and set an initial Country object. Update the Country to a new object.
  Act: Call getCountry method on the Address instance after the update.
  Assert: Assert that the returned Country object is the new Country object that was set last.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion checks that the getCountry method correctly reflects updates to the country field.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: This test ensures that the Address entity properly updates and retrieves updated data, which is critical for applications where address information is dynamically changed.

/*
The test case `getCountryWithNullValue` in the `AddressGetCountryTest` class is failing due to an assertion error that is not logically correct based on how the `Address` class is structured. The test case is asserting that the `country` attribute of an `Address` instance should be null when using the default constructor. However, according to the `Address` class's definition, the `country` field is explicitly initialized with a new `Country` object in the default constructor. This means that `country` will never be null if the default constructor is used.

The assertion `assertNull("Expected null as no country was set", actualCountry);` is expecting `actualCountry` to be null. However, since `actualCountry` is automatically initialized to a new `Country` instance when the `Address` default constructor is used, the assertion fails because `actualCountry` is not null.

To correct the test, the assertion should either expect a non-null value, or the default constructor of `Address` should not initialize `country` if the test needs to validate scenarios where `country` is null. Alternatively, the logic in the `Address` class or the test setup might need to be revised based on the intended use cases and requirements.
