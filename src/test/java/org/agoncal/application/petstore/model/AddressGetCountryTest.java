"""
Scenario 1: Verify getCountry returns a Country object
Details:
  TestName: testGetCountryReturnsValidCountryObject
  Description: This test is designed to check if the getCountry method returns a valid Country object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as the country object is initialized during class instantiation.
    Act: Invoke the getCountry method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned object is an instance of Country.
  Validation:
    The assertion is aimed at verifying that the getCountry method returns a valid Country object. This is expected because the country object is initialized during class instantiation. The validation of this method is crucial as it forms the basis for any interaction with the Country object.
Scenario 2: Verify getCountry returns the same Country object
Details:
  TestName: testGetCountryReturnsSameCountryObject
  Description: This test is designed to check if the getCountry method returns the same Country object every time it is invoked.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as the country object is initialized during class instantiation.
    Act: Invoke the getCountry method multiple times.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the same Country object is returned every time.
  Validation:
    The assertion is aimed at verifying that the getCountry method returns the same Country object every time. This is expected because the country object is a private member of the class and is not modified by the getCountry method. The validation of this method is important to ensure data consistency in the application.
Scenario 3: Verify getCountry handles null Country object
Details:
  TestName: testGetCountryHandlesNullCountryObject
  Description: This test is designed to check if the getCountry method handles a null Country object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the country object to null.
    Act: Invoke the getCountry method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned object is null.
  Validation:
    The assertion is aimed at verifying that the getCountry method can handle a null Country object and returns null in such a case. This is expected as the country object is a private member of the class and its value can be null. The validation of this method is important to prevent null pointer exceptions in the application.
