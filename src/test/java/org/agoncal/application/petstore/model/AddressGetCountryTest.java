Based on the provided information and the method `getCountry()`, here are some test scenarios:
```
Scenario 1: Get Country When Country is Set
Details:
  TestName: getCountryWhenCountryIsSet
  Description: Verify that the getCountry method returns the correct Country object when it has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set a Country object to it.
  Act: Call the getCountry method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned Country object matches the one that was set.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getCountry method correctly returns the Country object that was associated with the Address. It's important to verify this basic functionality to ensure that the relationship between Address and Country is maintained properly.
Scenario 2: Get Country When Country is Null
Details:
  TestName: getCountryWhenCountryIsNull
  Description: Verify that the getCountry method returns null when no Country has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object without setting a Country.
  Act: Call the getCountry method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  This test checks the behavior of getCountry when no Country has been associated with the Address. It's important to verify that the method handles this case gracefully by returning null, rather than throwing an exception or returning an unexpected value.
Scenario 3: Get Country After Setting Multiple Times
Details:
  TestName: getCountryAfterSettingMultipleTimes
  Description: Verify that the getCountry method returns the most recently set Country object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set a Country object. Then set a different Country object.
  Act: Call the getCountry method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned Country object matches the most recently set Country.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getCountry method always returns the most up-to-date Country associated with the Address. It's crucial to verify this behavior to ensure that updates to the Address's country are correctly reflected.
Scenario 4: Get Country Consistency Across Multiple Calls
Details:
  TestName: getCountryConsistencyAcrossMultipleCalls
  Description: Verify that multiple calls to getCountry return the same Country object without changes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set a Country object.
  Act: Call the getCountry method multiple times on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that all calls return the same Country object.
Validation:
  This test checks the consistency of the getCountry method. It ensures that repeated calls to the method return the same object, which is important for maintaining the integrity of the Address-Country relationship and preventing unexpected changes.
```
Note: These scenarios assume that there's a way to set the Country for an Address object, which isn't explicitly shown in the provided code. In a real implementation, you would need a corresponding setter method or constructor parameter to set the Country. If such a method doesn't exist, these scenarios would need to be adjusted accordingly.
