Scenario 1: Test to check if the getCountry method returns the correct country

Details:
  TestName: testGetCountryReturnsCorrectCountry.
  Description: This test checks if the getCountry method in the Address class returns the correct country that was previously set using the setCountry method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set a country using the setCountry method.
  Act: Invoke the getCountry method of the Address class instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned country is equal to the one that was set.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the getCountry method is working correctly and returns the correct country. The expected result is the same country that was set using the setCountry method. This test is significant as it ensures the correctness of the getCountry method which is crucial for retrieving the country of an address.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the getCountry method returns null when no country is set

Details:
  TestName: testGetCountryReturnsNullWhenNoCountryIsSet.
  Description: This test checks if the getCountry method in the Address class returns null when no country has been set using the setCountry method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class without setting a country.
  Act: Invoke the getCountry method of the Address class instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned country is null.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the getCountry method correctly handles the scenario where no country has been set. The expected result is null. This test is significant as it checks the robustness of the getCountry method and ensures it can handle edge cases correctly.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the getCountry method returns the last set country

Details:
  TestName: testGetCountryReturnsLastSetCountry.
  Description: This test checks if the getCountry method in the Address class returns the last country that was set using the setCountry method, even if the method was called multiple times.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set a country multiple times using the setCountry method.
  Act: Invoke the getCountry method of the Address class instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned country is equal to the last one that was set.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the getCountry method correctly returns the last set country even when the setCountry method is called multiple times. The expected result is the last country that was set. This test is significant as it ensures the correctness of the getCountry method when the setCountry method is used multiple times.

/*
The test `testGetCountryReturnsNullWhenNoCountryIsSet` is failing because it's expecting a `null` value, but it's getting an instance of `Country`. This is due to the default initialization of the `country` field in the `Address` class with `new Country()`. This means even if no country is set explicitly, the `getCountry()` method will return a `Country` object, not `null`.

The failure message "expected null, but was:<null>" is a bit misleading. It actually means that the test was expecting `null` but it got a non-null value (an instance of `Country`). The "<null>" here is the `toString()` representation of the `Country` object, which is likely overridden to return `null` for the default `Country` instance.

To resolve this, you could either change the test expectation to match the actual behavior or modify the `Address` class to not initialize a `Country` object by default. However, the appropriate solution would depend on the actual business requirements.
