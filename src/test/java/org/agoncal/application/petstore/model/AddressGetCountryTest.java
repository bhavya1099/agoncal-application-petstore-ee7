"Based on the provided information and the method `getCountry()`, here are several test scenarios for the Address class:

Scenario 1: Get Country When Country is Set

Details:
  TestName: getCountryWhenCountryIsSet
  Description: Verify that the getCountry method returns the correct Country object when it has been set.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set a Country object using the setCountry method.
  Act: Call the getCountry method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned Country object matches the one that was set.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the getCountry method correctly returns the Country object that was assigned to the Address. It validates the basic functionality of the getter method and confirms that the country field is properly stored and retrieved.

Scenario 2: Get Country When Country is Not Set

Details:
  TestName: getCountryWhenCountryIsNotSet
  Description: Check the behavior of getCountry when no Country has been explicitly set.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Address object without setting a Country.
  Act: Call the getCountry method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is not null and is an instance of Country.

Validation:
  This test verifies that even when a Country hasn't been explicitly set, the getCountry method returns a non-null Country object. This is because the country field is initialized with `new Country()` in the class definition. It's important to validate this default behavior.

Scenario 3: Get Country After Setting Null

Details:
  TestName: getCountryAfterSettingNull
  Description: Test the behavior of getCountry when the country field is explicitly set to null.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object, set its Country to null using setCountry(null).
  Act: Call the getCountry method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is null.

Validation:
  This test checks how the getCountry method behaves when the country field is explicitly set to null. It's important to verify if the method allows null values or if it maintains the default Country object.

Scenario 4: Get Country Consistency After Address Modifications

Details:
  TestName: getCountryConsistencyAfterAddressModifications
  Description: Ensure that modifying other fields of the Address does not affect the Country object.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object, set a Country, and then modify other fields like street1, city, etc.
  Act: Call the getCountry method after modifying other fields.
  Assert: Verify that the returned Country object is still the same as initially set.

Validation:
  This test confirms that modifications to other fields of the Address object do not inadvertently affect the Country object. It ensures the integrity and independence of the country field.

Scenario 5: Get Country in Equals Method Context

Details:
  TestName: getCountryInEqualsMethodContext
  Description: Verify that the getCountry method works correctly in the context of the equals method.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with the same fields including Country.
  Act: Call equals method on one Address object passing the other as an argument.
  Assert: Verify that the equals method returns true, implicitly using getCountry.

Validation:
  Although the equals method doesn't directly use getCountry, this test ensures that the Country object is correctly considered in object equality. It indirectly validates that getCountry is working as expected in different contexts within the class.

These scenarios cover various aspects of the getCountry method, including normal operation, edge cases, and its interaction with other parts of the Address class. They aim to ensure the method's reliability and correctness in different situations.
