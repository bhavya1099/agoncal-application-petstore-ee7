Scenario 1: Test to check if the getCountry method returns the correct country

Details:
  TestName: testGetCountryReturnsCorrectCountry.
  Description: This test checks if the getCountry method in the Address class returns the correct country that was previously set using the setCountry method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set a country using the setCountry method.
  Act: Invoke the getCountry method of the Address class instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned country is equal to the one that was set.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the getCountry method is working correctly and returns the correct country. The expected result is the same country that was set using the setCountry method. This test is significant as it ensures the correctness of the getCountry method which is crucial for retrieving the country of an address.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the getCountry method returns null when no country is set

Details:
  TestName: testGetCountryReturnsNullWhenNoCountryIsSet.
  Description: This test checks if the getCountry method in the Address class returns null when no country has been set using the setCountry method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class without setting a country.
  Act: Invoke the getCountry method of the Address class instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned country is null.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the getCountry method correctly handles the scenario where no country has been set. The expected result is null. This test is significant as it checks the robustness of the getCountry method and ensures it can handle edge cases correctly.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the getCountry method returns the last set country when setCountry is called multiple times

Details:
  TestName: testGetCountryReturnsLastSetCountry.
  Description: This test checks if the getCountry method in the Address class returns the last country that was set using the setCountry method when the method is called multiple times.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set multiple countries using the setCountry method.
  Act: Invoke the getCountry method of the Address class instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned country is equal to the last country that was set.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the getCountry method correctly returns the last set country when setCountry is called multiple times. The expected result is the last country that was set. This test is significant as it ensures the correctness of the getCountry method when used in scenarios where the country of an address can change.

/*
The failure in the test `testGetCountryReturnsNullWhenNoCountryIsSet` is due to the assertion expecting a `null` value for `address.getCountry()`, but it's actually returning an instance of `Country`.

The `Address` class has a default constructor that initializes the `country` field with a new `Country` instance. Therefore, when you create a new `Address` object using the default constructor and then call `getCountry()`, it doesn't return `null` but a new instance of `Country`.

This is why the assertion `assertNull(result, "getCountry should return null when no country is set");` fails. The `getCountry()` method is not returning `null` as expected by the test, but a new `Country` object.
