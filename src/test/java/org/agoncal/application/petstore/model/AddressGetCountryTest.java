"Scenario 1: Test to check if the getCountry method returns the correct country

Details:
  TestName: getCountryReturnsCorrectCountry.
  Description: This test is designed to check if the getCountry method is returning the correct Country object that was previously set using the setCountry method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Address object and a new Country object. Set the Country object to the Address using the setCountry method.
  Act: Invoke the getCountry method on the Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned Country object with the original Country object.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getCountry method correctly returns the Country that was previously set. The expected result is that the two Country objects are the same. This is significant because it ensures that the Address object is correctly storing and retrieving its Country attribute.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the getCountry method returns null when no country has been set

Details:
  TestName: getCountryReturnsNullWhenNoCountrySet.
  Description: This test is designed to check if the getCountry method returns null when no Country has been set to the Address object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Address object without setting a Country.
  Act: Invoke the getCountry method on the Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned Country object is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getCountry method correctly handles the case when no Country has been set to the Address object. The expected result is that the returned Country object is null. This is significant because it ensures that the Address object correctly handles cases when certain attributes are not set.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the getCountry method returns the latest set country

Details:
  TestName: getCountryReturnsLatestSetCountry.
  Description: This test is designed to check if the getCountry method returns the latest Country object that was set using the setCountry method, in the case where the setCountry method was called multiple times.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Address object and two new Country objects. Set the first Country object to the Address using the setCountry method, then set the second Country object to the Address.
  Act: Invoke the getCountry method on the Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned Country object with the second Country object.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getCountry method correctly returns the latest Country that was set. The expected result is that the returned Country object is the same as the second Country object. This is significant because it ensures that the Address object correctly updates its Country attribute when the setCountry method is called multiple times.
