Scenario 1: Test to check if the getCountry method returns the correct country

Details:
  TestName: testGetCountryReturnsCorrectCountry.
  Description: This test checks if the getCountry method in the Address class returns the correct country that was previously set using the setCountry method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set a country using the setCountry method.
  Act: Invoke the getCountry method of the Address class instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned country is equal to the one that was set.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify the correctness of the getCountry method in the Address class. The expected result is the country that was set using the setCountry method. The test is significant as it validates the basic functionality of the getter method getCountry in the Address class.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the getCountry method returns null when no country is set

Details:
  TestName: testGetCountryReturnsNullWhenNoCountryIsSet.
  Description: This test checks if the getCountry method in the Address class returns null when no country has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class without setting a country.
  Act: Invoke the getCountry method of the Address class instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned country is null.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify the behavior of the getCountry method when no country has been set in the Address class. The expected result is null. The test is significant as it checks the error handling capabilities of the getCountry method when no country is set.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the getCountry method returns the last set country

Details:
  TestName: testGetCountryReturnsLastSetCountry.
  Description: This test checks if the getCountry method in the Address class returns the last set country when the setCountry method is called multiple times.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set multiple countries using the setCountry method.
  Act: Invoke the getCountry method of the Address class instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned country is equal to the last one that was set.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify the behavior of the getCountry method when the setCountry method is called multiple times. The expected result is the last set country. The test is significant as it checks the functionality of the getCountry method in maintaining the state of the last set country.

/*
The test case `testGetCountryReturnsNullWhenNoCountryIsSet` is failing because it expects the `getCountry()` method to return null, however, it's not returning null. 

Based on the provided entity information, in the `Address` class, the `country` field is initialized with `new Country()` in its declaration. This means that even if no country is explicitly set, the `getCountry()` method will not return null as it's already initialized with a new `Country` object. 

Therefore, when the `assertNull(actualCountry);` line is executed in the test, it fails because `actualCountry` is not null, it's an instance of `Country` class. The error message "expected null, but was:<null>" is a bit misleading, it's likely a printing issue, it should be "expected null, but was:<Country>".

To fix the test, it should be revised to check for a new `Country` object or the `Address` class should be modified so that `country` is not initialized by default.
