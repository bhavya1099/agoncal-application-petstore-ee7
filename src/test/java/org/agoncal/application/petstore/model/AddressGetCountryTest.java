""" 
Scenario 1: Test to verify the correct country is returned

Details:  
  TestName: testCountryReturnedCorrectly.
  Description: This test is designed to check the functionality of the getCountry() method. The target scenario is when the method is called on an Address object with a set country. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set its country to a known value.
  Act: Invoke the getCountry() method on the created Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against the known country value.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getCountry() method is returning the correct country of the Address object. The expected result is the known country value since it is what was set in the Address object. This test is significant as it ensures the getCountry() method is correctly retrieving the country of an Address object.

Scenario 2: Test to verify null is returned when no country is set

Details:  
  TestName: testCountryReturnedNullWhenNoCountrySet.
  Description: This test is designed to check the functionality of the getCountry() method when no country is set in the Address object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object without setting a country.
  Act: Invoke the getCountry() method on the created Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned value is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getCountry() method returns null when no country is set in the Address object. This test is significant as it checks the method's behavior in a scenario where no country is set. 

Scenario 3: Test to check the method's behavior when the country is changed after being set

Details:  
  TestName: testCountryReturnedCorrectlyAfterChange.
  Description: This test is designed to check the getCountry() method's functionality when the country of the Address object is changed after it was set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object, set its country to a known value, and then change it to a different known value.
  Act: Invoke the getCountry() method on the created Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against the newly set country value.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getCountry() method is returning the updated country of the Address object. This test is significant as it checks the method's behavior when the country is changed after being set.
