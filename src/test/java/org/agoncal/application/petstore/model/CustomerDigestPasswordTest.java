The test function `digestPasswordWithNullInput` is intended to test the behavior of the method `digestPassword` when given a null input. The expectation, as indicated by the `@Test(expected = RuntimeException.class)` annotation, is that a `RuntimeException` will be thrown.

However, the test failure message states: "Unable to create test class 'org.agoncal.application.petstore.model.CustomerDigestPasswordTest'", which suggests there is an issue with setting up or recognizing the test class rather than an issue with the test logic itself.

This problem is likely due to one of the following reasons:
1. **Classpath Issues:** The test class `CustomerDigestPasswordTest` might not be correctly placed in the directory structure according to its package declaration, or there are issues with how the classpath is configured in the Maven project. This can prevent Maven from locating the test class during the test phase.

2. **Compilation Issues:** There could be compilation errors in the test class or related classes that prevent the test class from being correctly compiled and hence, recognized by Maven during the test execution phase.

3. **Maven Configuration Issues:** The Maven Surefire plugin configuration might be incorrect or conflicting. This can happen if the plugin is not configured to include the test class or if there are other Maven configuration issues that prevent the proper execution of tests.

4. **Incorrect Package or Import Statements:** If the package name or import statements in the `CustomerDigestPasswordTest` class are incorrect, this could also lead to issues with Maven not being able to find or create the test class.

To resolve this issue, you should:
- Verify that the test class is placed in the correct directory matching its package declaration.
- Check for any compilation errors in the test class and any related classes.
- Review the Maven Surefire plugin configuration in the `pom.xml` file to ensure it is set up to include and run tests from the correct directories.
- Ensure that all necessary dependencies are included in the Maven project and that there are no conflicts.

Once these areas are addressed, the test should be recognized and executed by Maven, and you should see a more appropriate failure related to the logic of the test if any exists (such as handling the null input as expected).

The test failure in the `digestPasswordWithSpecialCharacters` method appears to be related to a broader issue with the Maven Surefire Plugin and the test environment setup rather than a specific issue within the test code itself.

From the error logs, the key issues observed are:
1. **Maven Surefire Plugin Failure**: The error `org/junit/platform/engine/EngineDiscoveryListener` suggests there was a problem with the test engine discovery. This often indicates an incompatibility or misconfiguration with the versions of the JUnit platform, Surefire plugin, or other dependencies. It's a common issue when migrating to newer versions of JUnit or when there's a mismatch between the Maven Surefire plugin and the JUnit platform version used.

2. **Maven Configuration and Warnings**: There are multiple warnings about the Maven configuration, such as duplicate plugin declarations and usage of obsolete Java source/target versions. These don't directly cause the test to fail but indicate potential configuration issues that could lead to unstable builds.

3. **Dependency Issues**: The error logs suggest potential issues with dependencies not being correctly resolved or included, especially given the Surefire plugin's inability to execute due to `EngineDiscoveryListener`. This might be due to missing dependencies in the `pom.xml` for the correct operation of the JUnit platform with Maven Surefire.

To resolve these issues, consider the following steps:
- **Update Maven Surefire Plugin**: Ensure that the Maven Surefire plugin is compatible with the version of JUnit used. If using JUnit 5, the Surefire plugin must be configured correctly to support it.
- **Review and Update Dependencies**: Check `pom.xml` for correct and compatible versions of JUnit and related libraries. Ensure that all necessary dependencies for JUnit 5 are included, such as `junit-platform-engine`.
- **Fix Maven Configuration**: Resolve any duplicate plugin declarations and update the Java compiler plugin settings to use supported source/target versions, removing obsolete configurations.
- **Check for Classpath Issues**: Ensure that the classpath during the test execution phase includes all necessary JUnit platform libraries.

These steps should help in resolving the test execution failure and stabilize the Maven build configuration.

The failure of the test method `digestPasswordWithLongInput()` in the Maven project is primarily due to an error in the Maven Surefire plugin configuration, which is used to execute unit tests. The error log indicates a problem related to the test execution environment, specifically mentioning `org/junit/platform/engine/EngineDiscoveryListener`. This suggests that there is a likely issue with the integration or configuration of JUnit within the Maven Surefire plugin, rather than a direct problem with the test code itself.

Here are the key points extracted from the log indicating the nature of the problem:

1. **Surefire Plugin Error**: The error `org/junit/platform/engine/EngineDiscoveryListener` suggests that the Surefire plugin failed to load or recognize part of the JUnit platform necessary for discovering and running tests. This is not directly related to the test code but indicates a possible misconfiguration or compatibility issue between the versions of JUnit and the Surefire plugin used.

2. **Maven Build Failure**: The build process failed during the test phase executed by the Surefire plugin, which is specifically mentioned in the error log with `Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin:3.2.5:test`.

3. **Potential Version Incompatibility**: The warnings about the obsolete source and target values (`source value 8 is obsolete and will be removed in a future release`) could also hint at a broader issue of using outdated or incompatible tool versions that may affect the test execution environment.

4. **Duplicate Plugin Declaration**: There is a warning about a duplicate declaration of the Maven Surefire plugin. This might lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior during the build phase, particularly in how tests are configured and executed.

Given these points, the test failure is likely not due to the test logic itself but due to the project's Maven configuration affecting the test execution environment. The immediate steps to resolve this would involve:

- Checking and updating the Maven Surefire plugin configuration to ensure it is compatible with the version of JUnit used.
- Ensuring that there are no duplicate plugin declarations in the `pom.xml`.
- Updating the Java compiler's source and target settings to non-obsolete values if compatibility allows.
- Verifying that all necessary JUnit platform components are correctly integrated and available during the test phase.

These changes should help in successfully running the test and determining if there are any issues with the test logic itself.

    assertNotNull(digestedPassword);
    assertNotEquals(plainTextPassword, digestedPassword);
