Certainly! Below are several thoughtfully constructed JUnit test scenarios for the `digestPassword` method within the `Customer` class:

```plaintext
Scenario 1: Valid Password Digestion
Details:
  TestName: digestValidPassword
  Description: Test the digestion and Base64 encoding of a standard plaintext password. Verifies that the method processes a valid string and converts it into a non-null, expected hashed format.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a plain text password.
  Act: Call digestPassword with the plaintext password.
  Assert: Check that the output is not null and matches the expected hashed format.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: that the digest and encoding are done correctly and produce a consistent result each time for the same input.
  Elaborate on significance: Ensures password confidentiality and integrity during storage and verification processes.

Scenario 2: Null Password Input
Details:
  TestName: digestNullPassword
  Description: Test the behavior of digestPassword when provided with a null input, which should ideally handle the null input gracefully or throw a specific error.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set plaintext password to null.
  Act: Invoke digestPassword with a null password.
  Assert: Expect the method to either handle the null input gracefully, returning a specific value or throwing a NullPointerException.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: that the method has proper null handling mechanisms to prevent runtime exceptions during normal operations.
  Elaborate on significance: Critical for overall application stability, preventing unexpected crashes due to unhandled null inputs.

Scenario 3: Empty String Password
Details:
  TestName: digestEmptyStringPassword
  Description: Check how digestPassword handles an empty string. This scenario is important for understanding method behavior with minimal input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an empty string for the password.
  Act: Call digestPassword with the empty string.
  Assert: Verify that the result is not null and matches the expected hash of an empty string.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The method should consistently handle empty strings and produce a valid hash.
  Elaborate on significance: Ensures the method's robustness and correctness even when faced with edge inputs.

Scenario 4: Special Characters in Password
Details:
  TestName: digestPasswordWithSpecialCharacters
  Description: Test digestPassword's handling of strings containing special characters to verify that encoding handles all valid UTF-8 characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a password string with various special characters.
  Act: Digest the special characters password.
  Assert: Ensure the output is a valid Base64 string.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: That special characters do not disrupt the digest and encoding process.
  Elaborate on significance: Guarantees the method's capability to handle any valid user-input password without errors or misbehavior.

Scenario 5: Exception Handling on Internal Error
Details:
  TestName: simulateInternalErrorDuringDigestion
  Description: Test digestPasswordâ€™s robustness against potential internal errors, such as issues in the MessageDigest provider.
Execution:
  Arrange: Configure to simulate a failure within MessageDigest.getInstance or update.
  Act: Call digestPassword and expect it to throw a RuntimeException.
  Assert: Catch the expected RuntimeException.
Validation:
  Clarify the intent: Ensure that all internal exceptions are caught and wrapped properly, preventing any propagation of unchecked exceptions.
  Elaborate on significance: Enhances error handling and resilience ensuring that the application can handle faults gracefully.

/*
The test function `digestNullPassword` is specifically designed to expect and handle a `NullPointerException` when `null` is passed as a parameter to `digestPassword`. However, the business logic implemented in `digestPassword` catches all exceptions, including `NullPointerException`, and rethrows them as a `RuntimeException`. This causes a mismatch between the expected exception type in the test (`NullPointerException`) and the actual exception thrown (`RuntimeException`).

Consequently, the test fails because it is setup to expect a `NullPointerException`, but instead encounters a `RuntimeException` due to the catch-all error handling mechanism in the `digestPassword` method. This discrepancy prompts the test framework (JUnit) to report an "Unexpected exception" error, indicating the difference in the expected and actual exceptions handled during the test execution.

To correct this behavior, the exception handling within `digestPassword` needs to be adjusted so that it doesn't catch and convert `NullPointerException` into `RuntimeException`, or the test needs to be revised to expect `RuntimeException` instead of `NullPointerException`.

/*
The failure of the test method `simulateInternalErrorDuringDigestion` in the `CustomerDigestPasswordTest` class is due to the incorrect expectation of a `RuntimeException` not being met. From the detailed error log, we can see that the test is structured to expect a `RuntimeException` to be thrown when the `digestPassword` method of the `Customer` class is called with an intentionally induced error via the `simulateError()` method. However, the test fails because this expected exception was not thrown.

Here is a breakdown of the issue:
- The test method `simulateInternalErrorDuringDigestion` uses `@Test(expected = RuntimeException.class)` to specify that a `RuntimeException` should occur during the test.
- The method `simulateError()` is assumed to create a fault condition that should lead the subsequent call to `Customer.digestPassword()` to fail and throw a `RuntimeException`.
- If the test is failing with a `java.lang.AssertionError: Expected exception: java.lang.RuntimeException`, it suggests that the `RuntimeException` is not being thrown as anticipated during this test scenario.

Possible causes for this could include:
1. **The `simulateError()` method does not effectively cause the `MessageDigest` instance in the `digestPassword` method to fail.** If the method does not properly set up the error condition (e.g., misconfiguration or insufficient error simulation), then the `digestPassword` method might still execute without throwing a `RuntimeException`.
2. **Exception handling inside the `digestPassword` method:** Even if `simulateError()` successfully induces an error, the try-catch block within `digestPassword` may handle it in such a way that prevents the propagation of a `RuntimeException`.

To resolve the test failure, it is necessary to ensure that `simulateError()` correctly simulates a condition where `MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256")` cannot operate as expected (or similar operational fail within the method), directly leading to an unavoidable `RuntimeException` that is not caught or handled elsewhere within the method. Furthermore, confirm that no other part of the code (including test setup and the method being tested) suppresses or otherwise handles this exception in a way that prevents it from fulfilling the test's expectations.
@Test(expected = RuntimeException.class)
@Category(Categories.integration.class)
public void simulateInternalErrorDuringDigestion() {
    String plainTextPassword = "normalPassword";
    // Assuming the simulateError() method sets up a condition that causes
    // MessageDigest to fail
    simulateError();
    customer.digestPassword(plainTextPassword);
}
