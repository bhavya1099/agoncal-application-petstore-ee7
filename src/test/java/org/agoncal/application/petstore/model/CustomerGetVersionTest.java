Based on the provided method and class information, here are several test scenarios for the `getVersion()` method:
Scenario 1: Retrieve Default Version Value
Details:
  TestName: retrieveDefaultVersionValue
  Description: Verify that the getVersion method returns the default value of the version field when it hasn't been explicitly set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the class containing the getVersion method.
  Act: Call the getVersion method on the newly created instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is 0 (assuming int fields are initialized to 0 by default in Java).
Validation:
  This test verifies that the getVersion method correctly returns the default value of the version field when it hasn't been explicitly set. It's important to ensure that the method behaves correctly with default values to prevent unexpected behavior in the application.
Scenario 2: Retrieve Set Version Value
Details:
  TestName: retrieveSetVersionValue
  Description: Verify that the getVersion method returns the correct value after the version has been set using a setter method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the class containing the getVersion method. Use a setter method (assuming one exists) to set the version to a specific value, e.g., 5.
  Act: Call the getVersion method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is equal to the value that was set (5 in this case).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getVersion method correctly retrieves the version value after it has been explicitly set. It validates that the method is properly accessing the private version field and returning its current value.
Scenario 3: Version Consistency After Object Modifications
Details:
  TestName: versionConsistencyAfterModifications
  Description: Verify that the version returned by getVersion remains consistent even after modifying other fields of the object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the class. Set the version to a specific value (e.g., 3) using a setter method. Modify other fields of the object such as firstName, lastName, email, etc.
  Act: Call the getVersion method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is still equal to the initially set version (3 in this case).
Validation:
  This test ensures that modifications to other fields of the object do not inadvertently affect the version field. It's crucial to maintain the integrity of the version field as it might be used for concurrency control or tracking changes.
Scenario 4: Version Immutability
Details:
  TestName: versionImmutability
  Description: Verify that the version cannot be modified directly through the getVersion method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the class and set the version to a specific value (e.g., 2) using a setter method.
  Act: Call the getVersion method and attempt to modify the returned value.
  Assert: Call getVersion again and assert that the returned value is still the originally set value (2).
Validation:
  This test verifies that the getVersion method returns a primitive int value, which is passed by value in Java, ensuring that the internal version field cannot be modified directly through this method. This is important for maintaining the integrity of the version field.
Scenario 5: Version Consistency Across Multiple Calls
Details:
  TestName: versionConsistencyAcrossMultipleCalls
  Description: Verify that multiple calls to getVersion return the same value without any internal changes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the class and set the version to a specific value (e.g., 4) using a setter method.
  Act: Call the getVersion method multiple times in succession.
  Assert: Assert that all calls return the same value (4 in this case).
Validation:
  This test ensures that repeated calls to getVersion do not cause any unintended side effects or changes to the version value. It validates the consistency and reliability of the method across multiple invocations.
These test scenarios cover various aspects of the getVersion method, including default behavior, set value retrieval, consistency, immutability, and reliability across multiple calls. They aim to ensure that the method behaves correctly under different circumstances and maintains the integrity of the version field.
