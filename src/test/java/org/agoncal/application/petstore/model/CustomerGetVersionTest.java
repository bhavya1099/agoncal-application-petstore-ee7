```
Scenario 1: Verify getVersion returns correct version

Details:
  TestName: getVersionReturnsCorrectVersion
  Description: The test checks if the getVersion method returns the correct version number as set in the entity. This scenario ensures that the version field is accurately retrieved and has not been manipulated unexpectedly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a Customer object and set the version field to a known integer value using setVersion method.
  Act: Call the getVersion method to retrieve the version.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned version matches the value set during the Arrange step.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: The test validates if the getVersion method correctly retrieves the version number that is currently set in the Customer object. Ensuring correct behavior of getter methods is crucial as they are often used in decision-making processes throughout the application.

Scenario 2: Verify getVersion consistency after multiple retrievals

Details:
  TestName: getVersionConsistencyCheck
  Description: This test verifies if consecutive calls to getVersion return the same value, ensuring that the getVersion method does not alter the state or yield inconsistent results over successive invocations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Customer object and set a specific version using setVersion method.
  Act: Call the getVersion method multiple times (at least twice) and capture the results.
  Assert: Check that all the retrieved values are identical using JUnit assertions.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: Consistency in the output of getVersion through multiple calls indicates the absence of side-effects and reliability in the method's implementation. This is vital for debugging and operational stability, where methods might be called repeatedly in a single transaction or session.

Scenario 3: Verify initial getVersion value on a new Customer instance

Details:
  TestName: getVersionOnNewCustomer
  Description: This test checks the initial value returned by getVersion when called on a newly instantiated Customer object before any version has been explicitly set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a new Customer object without setting the version.
  Act: Call the getVersion method to retrieve the initial version value.
  Assert: Assert that the initial version value is the default integer value (typically 0, depending on initialization in the Customer class).
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: This test assesses the default state of a new Customer instance concerning the version field. Verifying initial states is critical for understanding object lifecycle and for scenarios where new objects are persisted or processed with default values.
```
These scenarios encapsulate basic functional tests aimed at verifying the correctness and reliability of the getVersion method in various common and edge cases encountered in application workflows.
