Scenario 1: Verify getVersion returns correct version after initialization

Details:
  TestName: getVersionAfterInitialization
  Description: This test checks if the getVersion method returns the correct version number when a Customer object is newly instantiated and no version is explicitly set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of Customer.
  Act: Call the getVersion method on the newly created Customer instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned version is the default version value (typically 0 if not set).
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion verifies that the default state of version is correctly maintained in a new Customer instance.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensuring that the version field is correctly initialized and returned helps in managing entity versioning correctly, which is crucial for ORM frameworks like JPA for handling optimistic concurrency.

Scenario 2: Verify getVersion returns updated version after setting a new version

Details:
  TestName: getVersionAfterSettingNewVersion
  Description: This test verifies that the getVersion method correctly returns the updated version number after the version is set to a new value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Customer and set a new version using setVersion.
  Act: Call the getVersion method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned version matches the newly set version.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion checks that the version setter correctly updates the version field and the getVersion method accurately retrieves this updated value.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: This test is important to confirm that the Customer entity's version management works as expected, which is critical for data integrity and concurrency control in database transactions.

Scenario 3: Verify getVersion consistency over multiple calls

Details:
  TestName: getVersionConsistencyCheck
  Description: This test ensures that multiple calls to getVersion return consistent results when no changes are made to the version field in between the calls.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Customer and optionally set a version.
  Act: Call getVersion method multiple times.
  Assert: Assert that all calls to getVersion return the same value.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion verifies that the getVersion method provides a consistent read of the version field across multiple invocations.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensuring consistency of getter methods is crucial for the reliability of the entity's state management, particularly in multi-threaded environments where entity instances might be shared.

Scenario 4: Verify getVersion returns correct version after entity rehydration from persistence context

Details:
  TestName: getVersionAfterRehydration
  Description: This test checks if getVersion returns the correct version after the Customer entity is rehydrated (reloaded) from the database or persistence context, simulating ORM behavior.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate the loading of a Customer entity with a specific version set from a database.
  Act: Call getVersion on the rehydrated entity.
  Assert: Assert that the returned version matches the expected version that was initially set in the database.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test checks that version management persists through database operations correctly.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: This scenario is significant for ensuring that entity versioning works correctly across database operations, which is crucial for ORM-based applications to handle data consistency and concurrency.
```

These scenarios cover a range of typical use cases for the `getVersion` method in an entity class, ensuring that the versioning system behaves as expected in different situations, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity and consistency of data in applications using ORM frameworks.
