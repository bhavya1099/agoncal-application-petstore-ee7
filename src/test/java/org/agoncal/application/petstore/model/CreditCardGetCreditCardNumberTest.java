Scenario 1: Test to get valid Credit Card Number

Details:
  TestName: testGetValidCreditCardNumber.
  Description: This test case is meant to check the getCreditCardNumber method returns a valid credit card number when invoked.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CreditCard object and set a valid credit card number using the setCreditCardNumber method.
  Act: Invoke the getCreditCardNumber method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned credit card number against the one set in the Arrange step.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getCreditCardNumber method correctly returns the credit card number set in the CreditCard object. This test is significant as it confirms the basic functionality of the getter method for the credit card number.

Scenario 2: Test to get Credit Card Number when no value has been set

Details:
  TestName: testGetCreditCardNumberWithoutSettingValue.
  Description: This test case is meant to check the getCreditCardNumber method returns null or a default value when no credit card number has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CreditCard object without setting a credit card number.
  Act: Invoke the getCreditCardNumber method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned credit card number is null or a default value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getCreditCardNumber method correctly handles the scenario where no credit card number has been set in the CreditCard object. This test is significant as it checks the robustness of the getter method for unexpected scenarios.

Scenario 3: Test to check the immutability of the Credit Card Number field

Details:
  TestName: testImmutabilityOfCreditCardNumber.
  Description: This test case is meant to check the immutability of the credit card number field. This is done by attempting to modify the credit card number after it has been set and ensuring that the original value remains unchanged.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CreditCard object and set a credit card number. Then, attempt to modify this credit card number.
  Act: Invoke the getCreditCardNumber method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned credit card number against the original value set in the Arrange step.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the credit card number field is immutable and cannot be changed once set. This test is significant as it checks the integrity of the CreditCard object's data.
