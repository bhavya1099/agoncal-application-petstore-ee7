Based on the provided method and additional information, here are several test scenarios for the getCreditCardNumber() method:
Scenario 1: Retrieve Valid Credit Card Number
Details:
  TestName: getCreditCardNumberReturnsValidNumber
  Description: Verify that the method returns a valid credit card number when it has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a valid credit card number to the creditCardNumber field.
  Act: Call the getCreditCardNumber() method.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the set credit card number.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getter method correctly returns the stored credit card number. It's crucial for maintaining data integrity and proper information retrieval in the application.
Scenario 2: Retrieve Null Credit Card Number
Details:
  TestName: getCreditCardNumberReturnsNull
  Description: Verify that the method returns null when no credit card number has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure the creditCardNumber field is null (default state).
  Act: Call the getCreditCardNumber() method.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the method behaves correctly when no credit card number has been set, which is important for handling optional or uninitialized data.
Scenario 3: Retrieve Credit Card Number After Setting
Details:
  TestName: getCreditCardNumberAfterSetting
  Description: Verify that the method returns the correct credit card number after it has been changed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set an initial credit card number, then change it to a new value.
  Act: Call the getCreditCardNumber() method.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the newly set credit card number.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getter method reflects changes to the credit card number, which is crucial for maintaining data consistency after updates.
Scenario 4: Retrieve Credit Card Number with Maximum Length
Details:
  TestName: getCreditCardNumberWithMaximumLength
  Description: Verify that the method correctly returns a credit card number of maximum allowed length.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a credit card number with the maximum length allowed by the @Size annotation.
  Act: Call the getCreditCardNumber() method.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the set maximum-length credit card number.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getter method works correctly with credit card numbers at the upper bound of the allowed length, which is important for boundary testing and data validation.
Scenario 5: Retrieve Credit Card Number with Minimum Length
Details:
  TestName: getCreditCardNumberWithMinimumLength
  Description: Verify that the method correctly returns a credit card number of minimum allowed length.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a credit card number with the minimum length allowed by the @Size annotation.
  Act: Call the getCreditCardNumber() method.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the set minimum-length credit card number.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getter method works correctly with credit card numbers at the lower bound of the allowed length, which is important for boundary testing and data validation.
Scenario 6: Retrieve Credit Card Number After Setting Other Fields
Details:
  TestName: getCreditCardNumberAfterSettingOtherFields
  Description: Verify that the method returns the correct credit card number after setting other related fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set values for creditCardType and creditCardExpDate, then set the creditCardNumber.
  Act: Call the getCreditCardNumber() method.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the set credit card number.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getter method works correctly in the context of a fully populated object, verifying that other field operations don't interfere with the credit card number retrieval.
These scenarios cover various aspects of the getCreditCardNumber() method, including normal operation, edge cases, and potential interactions with other fields in the class.
