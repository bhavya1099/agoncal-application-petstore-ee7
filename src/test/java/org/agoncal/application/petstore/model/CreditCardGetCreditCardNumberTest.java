Based on the provided information and the method getCreditCardNumber(), here are several test scenarios:
Scenario 1: Retrieve Valid Credit Card Number
Details:
  TestName: getCreditCardNumberReturnsValidNumber
  Description: Verify that the getCreditCardNumber method returns the correct credit card number when it has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CreditCard instance and set a valid credit card number using setCreditCardNumber.
  Act: Call getCreditCardNumber on the CreditCard instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the set credit card number.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getter method correctly retrieves the stored credit card number, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity and proper functionality of the CreditCard entity.
Scenario 2: Retrieve Null Credit Card Number
Details:
  TestName: getCreditCardNumberReturnsNull
  Description: Verify that getCreditCardNumber returns null when no credit card number has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new CreditCard instance without setting a credit card number.
  Act: Call getCreditCardNumber on the CreditCard instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  This test checks the behavior of getCreditCardNumber when no value has been set, ensuring that it handles the null case correctly, which is important for error prevention and data consistency.
Scenario 3: Retrieve Credit Card Number After Multiple Sets
Details:
  TestName: getCreditCardNumberReturnsLatestSetValue
  Description: Verify that getCreditCardNumber returns the most recently set credit card number after multiple setCreditCardNumber calls.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CreditCard instance, set an initial credit card number, then set a different number.
  Act: Call getCreditCardNumber on the CreditCard instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the last set credit card number.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getter method always returns the most up-to-date value, which is critical for maintaining accurate credit card information in the system.
Scenario 4: Retrieve Credit Card Number with Special Characters
Details:
  TestName: getCreditCardNumberReturnsValueWithSpecialCharacters
  Description: Verify that getCreditCardNumber correctly returns a credit card number containing special characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CreditCard instance and set a credit card number that includes special characters (e.g., dashes or spaces).
  Act: Call getCreditCardNumber on the CreditCard instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value exactly matches the set credit card number, including special characters.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getter method handles and preserves special characters in credit card numbers, which is important for supporting various credit card number formats.
Scenario 5: Retrieve Credit Card Number After Setting Empty String
Details:
  TestName: getCreditCardNumberReturnsEmptyString
  Description: Verify that getCreditCardNumber returns an empty string when an empty string has been set as the credit card number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CreditCard instance and set an empty string as the credit card number using setCreditCardNumber.
  Act: Call getCreditCardNumber on the CreditCard instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is an empty string.
Validation:
  This test checks the behavior of getCreditCardNumber when an empty string is set, ensuring that it correctly handles this edge case, which is important for data validation and error handling in the application.
