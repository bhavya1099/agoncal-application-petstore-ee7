```plaintext
Scenario 1: Retrieve Existing Credit Card Number
Details:  
    TestName: retrieveExistingCreditCardNumber
    Description: Test to ensure that the getCreditCardNumber method correctly retrieves the credit card number that has been previously set.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the CreditCard entity and use the setCreditCardNumber method to set a known credit card number.
    Act: Call the getCreditCardNumber method to retrieve the credit card number.
    Assert: Assert that the returned credit card number matches the one that was set.
Validation: 
    Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion verifies that the getCreditCardNumber method correctly returns the credit card number that was set, ensuring data integrity and correct data retrieval.
    Elaborate on the significance of the test: This test is crucial for validating that the CreditCard entity handles the storage and retrieval of critical information correctly, which is essential for transaction processing and audit purposes.
Scenario 2: Default Value for Credit Card Number
Details:  
    TestName: checkDefaultCreditCardNumberValue
    Description: Test to check the default value of the credit card number when it has not been set explicitly.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new instance of the CreditCard entity without setting the credit card number.
    Act: Invoke the getCreditCardNumber method to retrieve the credit card number.
    Assert: Assert that the retrieved credit card number is null or some predefined default value (if applicable).
Validation: 
    Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion checks whether the credit card number is null when it has not been explicitly set, which is important to understand the initial state of the entity.
    Elaborate on the significance of the test: This test helps ensure that the system behaves as expected in scenarios where new CreditCard entities are created but not immediately populated, preventing unexpected behavior in subsequent operations.
Scenario 3: Credit Card Number Consistency After Multiple Sets
Details:  
    TestName: ensureCreditCardNumberConsistencyAfterMultipleSets
    Description: Ensure that the latest set value is retrieved by the getCreditCardNumber method after multiple sets.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the CreditCard entity and use the setCreditCardNumber method multiple times with different values.
    Act: Call the getCreditCardNumber method to retrieve the current credit card number.
    Assert: Assert that the retrieved credit card number matches the last value set.
Validation: 
    Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test ensures that the getCreditCardNumber method retrieves the most recent value set, demonstrating the entity's ability to update and retrieve the latest information correctly.
    Elaborate on the significance of the test: This scenario is vital for applications where credit card information may be updated and needs to reflect the most current data accurately.
These scenarios collectively ensure that the CreditCard entity's getCreditCardNumber method functions correctly across various typical and edge cases, maintaining data integrity and reliability.
