Scenario 1: Test for retrieving null street name
TestName: testRetrieveNullStreetName
Description: This test aims to check the getStreet2() method when an attempt is made to retrieve a street name before it is initialized or if it is not set to any value.
Execution:
  Arrange: We need to initialize a new object instance where all fields are null. No need for mock data or test doubles.
  Act: Invoke the getStreet2() method.
  Assert: As street2 is null, assert that the return value equals null.
Validation: 
  This test aims to ensure that the getStreet2() method accurately returns null when the street name(Street2) is null. It's significant as it verifies that the method doesn't produce unwanted behavior when dealing with non-initialized field values.
Scenario 2: Test to retrieve an initialized street name
TestName: testRetrieveInitializedStreetName
Description: This test aims to evaluate the getStreet2() method after the street name has been set or initialized.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a new object instance and set the value of street2 to any string.
  Act: Invoke the getStreet2() method.
  Assert: As street2 has a value, assert that the return value is equal to the set value for street2 field.
Validation: 
  This test aims to ensure that the getStreet2() method accurately returns the initialized or set value of the street name. It checks if the method is behaving as expected when retrieving initialized data.
Scenario 3: Test to retrieve an empty street name
TestName: testRetrieveEmptyStreetName
Description: The aim is to see how the getStreet2() method responds when the street's name field is set to an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a new object instance and set the value of street2 as an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the getStreet2() method.
  Assert: As street2 is set to an empty string, assert that the return value equals "".
Validation: 
  This test aims to ensure that the getStreet2() method correctly retrieves the street2 field when it is set as an empty string, indicating that the method correctly handles and returns empty values.
Scenario 4: Test to retrieve street name with special characters
TestName: testRetrieveStreetNameWithSpecialChars
Description: This test aims to check the getStreet2() method when the street's name field contains special characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a new object instance and set the value of street2 as a string with special characters.
  Act: Invoke the getStreet2() method.
  Assert: As street2 is set to contain special characters, assert that the returned value equals the set value.
Validation: 
  This test ensures that the getStreet2() method can accurately retrieve a street name containing special characters. Checking such aspects means testing the method's reliability when dealing with various string input types.
