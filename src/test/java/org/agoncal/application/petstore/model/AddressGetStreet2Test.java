Scenario 1: Test for Valid Street2 Value

Details:
  TestName: testValidStreet2Value.
  Description: This test is designed to check the functionality of the getStreet2() method when valid street2 value is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: An Address object is created with a valid street2 value set using the setStreet2() method.
  Act: Invoke the getStreet2() method of the Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value from getStreet2() is equal to the value set earlier.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getStreet2() method correctly retrieves the value of street2 that was set earlier. This test ensures that the getter method is working as expected.

Scenario 2: Test for Null Street2 Value

Details:
  TestName: testNullStreet2Value.
  Description: This test is designed to check the functionality of the getStreet2() method when null value is set for street2.
Execution:
  Arrange: An Address object is created with null value set for street2 using the setStreet2() method.
  Act: Invoke the getStreet2() method of the Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value from getStreet2() is null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getStreet2() method correctly handles null values and does not throw any exceptions. This test ensures that the getter method can handle null inputs.

Scenario 3: Test for Empty Street2 Value

Details:
  TestName: testEmptyStreet2Value.
  Description: This test is designed to check the functionality of the getStreet2() method when an empty string is set for street2.
Execution:
  Arrange: An Address object is created with an empty string set for street2 using the setStreet2() method.
  Act: Invoke the getStreet2() method of the Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value from getStreet2() is an empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getStreet2() method correctly handles empty strings and does not throw any exceptions. This test ensures that the getter method can handle empty string inputs.
