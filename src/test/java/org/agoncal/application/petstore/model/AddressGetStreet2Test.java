"""
Scenario 1: Test to verify the default value of street2

Details:
  TestName: testDefaultStreet2Value.
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the default value of the street2 attribute is null or not.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class.
  Act: Invoke the getStreet2 method without setting any value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the default value of street2 is null. The significance of this test is to ensure that uninitialized fields return null by default.

Scenario 2: Test to verify the set and get functionality for street2

Details:
  TestName: testSetAndGetStreet2.
  Description: This test is designed to check the set and get functionality of the street2 attribute.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set a value for street2.
  Act: Invoke the getStreet2 method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value matches the set value.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the set value is correctly retrieved by the get method. This test confirms the basic set/get functionality for the street2 attribute.

Scenario 3: Test to verify the toString method for street2

Details:
  TestName: testStreet2InToString.
  Description: This test is designed to check if the street2 attribute is correctly included in the toString method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set a value for street2.
  Act: Invoke the toString method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned string contains the set street2 value.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the toString method correctly includes the street2 value. This test ensures the correct functionality of the toString method for the street2 attribute.

Scenario 4: Test to verify the equals method for street2

Details:
  TestName: testStreet2InEqualsMethod.
  Description: This test is designed to check if the equals method correctly compares the street2 attribute.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the Address class with the same street2 value.
  Act: Invoke the equals method to compare the two instances.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the equals method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly compares the street2 attribute. However, the equals method in the provided Address class doesn't consider the street2 value, so the test should result in a successful comparison even if the street2 values are different.

/*
The test failure is due to a NullPointerException that is being thrown when invoking the equals method on the address1 object. The error message "Cannot invoke "String.equals(Object)" because "this.street1" is null" indicates that the equals method of the Address class is trying to check the equality of the 'street1' field of two Address objects. 

But in the testStreet2InEqualsMethod test, only the 'street2' field is set for the address1 and address2 objects, while the 'street1' field is left as null. When the equals method is invoked on the address1 object with address2 as a parameter, it tries to invoke the equals method on the 'street1' field, which is null, hence the NullPointerException.

The solution to this issue would be to either check for null in the equals method of the Address class before invoking equals on 'street1' or to ensure that 'street1' is initialized before invoking the equals method in the test. 

However, as per the given task, you are not expected to provide a solution but only the explanation for the failure. The explanation is that the test fails because the equals method in the Address class does not handle the case where 'street1' is null.
@Test
@Category(Categories.valid.class)
public void testStreet2InEqualsMethod() {
    // Arrange
    Address address1 = new Address();
    Address address2 = new Address();
    String street2 = "2nd Street";
    address1.setStreet2(street2);
    address2.setStreet2(street2);
    // Act & Assert
    assertTrue(address1.equals(address2));
