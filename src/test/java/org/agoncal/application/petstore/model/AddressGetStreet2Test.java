"""
Scenario 1: Test to verify getter method for street2 when street2 has a value
Details:  
  TestName: testGetStreet2WithValue
  Description: This test is meant to check the getStreet2() method when street2 field has a value. It aims to verify that the method correctly returns the street2 value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address and set a value for street2 using setStreet2() method.
  Act: Invoke getStreet2() method on the created Address instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertion to verify that the returned value is equal to the value set for street2.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that getStreet2() method correctly returns the value of street2 field when it has a value. This is significant as it ensures correct retrieval of street2 data.

Scenario 2: Test to verify getter method for street2 when street2 is null
Details:  
  TestName: testGetStreet2WithNullValue
  Description: This test is meant to check the getStreet2() method when street2 field is null. It aims to verify that the method correctly handles null values and does not throw an exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address without setting a value for street2, hence it remains null.
  Act: Invoke getStreet2() method on the created Address instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertion to verify that the returned value is null.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that getStreet2() method correctly handles null values for the street2 field and does not throw an exception. This is significant as it ensures robustness of the method in handling null values.

Scenario 3: Test to verify getter method for street2 when street2 has empty string
Details:  
  TestName: testGetStreet2WithEmptyString
  Description: This test is meant to check the getStreet2() method when street2 field is an empty string. It aims to verify that the method correctly returns the empty string without throwing an exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address and set an empty string for street2 using setStreet2() method.
  Act: Invoke getStreet2() method on the created Address instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertion to verify that the returned value is an empty string.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that getStreet2() method correctly handles empty string values for the street2 field and does not throw an exception. This is significant as it ensures the method's ability to handle different string inputs.
