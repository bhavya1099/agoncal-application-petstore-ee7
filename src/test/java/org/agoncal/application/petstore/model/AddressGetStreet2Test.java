Based on the provided information and the method `getStreet2()`, here are some test scenarios:
Scenario 1: Retrieve Street2 Value When Set
Details:
  TestName: getStreet2WhenValueIsSet
  Description: This test verifies that the getStreet2 method correctly returns the value of street2 when it has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set a value for street2.
  Act: Call the getStreet2 method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the set value.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getStreet2 method correctly retrieves the street2 value. It's important to verify this basic functionality to ensure that the Address object correctly stores and returns the secondary street information.
Scenario 2: Retrieve Null Street2 Value
Details:
  TestName: getStreet2WhenValueIsNull
  Description: This test checks the behavior of getStreet2 when the street2 value hasn't been set (null).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object without setting a value for street2.
  Act: Call the getStreet2 method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  This test validates that the getStreet2 method handles the case where street2 hasn't been set. It's crucial to ensure that the method behaves correctly with null values to prevent potential null pointer exceptions in the application.
Scenario 3: Retrieve Empty String Street2 Value
Details:
  TestName: getStreet2WhenValueIsEmptyString
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of getStreet2 when street2 is set to an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set street2 to an empty string.
  Act: Call the getStreet2 method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is an empty string.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getStreet2 method correctly handles and returns empty strings. It's important to distinguish between null and empty string values in address information, as they might have different meanings in the context of the application.
Scenario 4: Retrieve Street2 Value After Multiple Sets
Details:
  TestName: getStreet2AfterMultipleSets
  Description: This test checks if getStreet2 returns the most recently set value after multiple sets.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set street2 multiple times with different values.
  Act: Call the getStreet2 method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the last set value.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getStreet2 method always returns the most up-to-date value of street2. It's crucial to verify this behavior to ensure that any updates to the address are correctly reflected when retrieved.
Note: These test scenarios focus solely on the `getStreet2()` method and do not assume the existence of any setter methods or other properties that were not explicitly provided in the given information. The scenarios cover basic functionality, null handling, empty string handling, and consistency after multiple hypothetical updates.
