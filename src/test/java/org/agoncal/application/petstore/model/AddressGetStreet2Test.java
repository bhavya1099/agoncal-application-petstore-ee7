### Test Scenarios for `getStreet2` Method of `Address` Entity
#### Scenario 1: Verify getStreet2 with Non-Empty Street2 Value
**Details:**
- TestName: shouldReturnNonEmptyStreet2
- Description: Checks if getStreet2 correctly fetches a non-empty street2 string that was previously set.

**Execution:**
- Arrange: Create an instance of Address and set a non-empty value for street2 using `setStreet2`.
- Act: Call `getStreet2` on the Address instance.
- Assert: Verify that the result matches the non-empty string set earlier.

**Validation:**
- The assertion checks that getStreet2 returns the exact string that was set, verifying the getter's ability to correctly retrieve the street2 field value.
- This test is significant as it ensures the basic functionality of the getter method in returning the correct street2 data, which is crucial for accurate address representations in the application.
#### Scenario 2: Verify getStreet2 with Null Value
**Details:**
- TestName: shouldReturnNullWhenStreet2IsNull
- Description: Ensures that getStreet2 returns null when street2 has not been set.

**Execution:**
- Arrange: Create a new Address instance without setting street2.
- Act: Call `getStreet2` on the Address instance.
- Assert: Verify that the result is null.

**Validation:**
- This assertion confirms that getStreet2 can handle and return null values, which is expected behavior when the street2 field is unset.
- This test is crucial for ensuring the method's robustness in cases where the street2 field is optional and might not be provided.
#### Scenario 3: Verify getStreet2 with Empty String Value
**Details:**
- TestName: shouldReturnEmptyStringWhenStreet2IsEmpty
- Description: Checks if getStreet2 correctly returns an empty string when street2 is set to an empty string.

**Execution:**
- Arrange: Create an Address instance and set street2 to an empty string using `setStreet2`.
- Act: Call `getStreet2` on the Address instance.
- Assert: Verify that the result is an empty string.

**Validation:**
- This test confirms that getStreet2 correctly returns an empty string, ensuring that the getter accurately reflects the state of the street2 field even when it contains no characters.
- Testing for empty strings is essential as it helps in validating that the system accurately processes and returns data as expected without alterations or errors.
#### Scenario 4: Verify getStreet2 with Special Characters
**Details:**
- TestName: shouldHandleSpecialCharactersInStreet2
- Description: Ensures that getStreet2 can handle and return street2 values containing special characters.

**Execution:**
- Arrange: Set the street2 of an Address instance to a string containing special characters.
- Act: Call `getStreet2` on this Address instance.
- Assert: Verify that the returned string matches the one set, including special characters.

**Validation:**
- This assertion checks that special characters in street2 are not corrupted or altered, which is important for data integrity and accurate representation of address fields.
- The significance of this test lies in ensuring that the application can handle addresses with special characters, which might be common in some locales or specific address formats.
These scenarios comprehensively test the `getStreet2` method under various conditions, ensuring that the method behaves as expected across a wide range of input values.
