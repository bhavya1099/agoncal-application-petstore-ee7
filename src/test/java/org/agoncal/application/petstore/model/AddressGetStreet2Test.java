Scenario 1: Validate getStreet2 method when Street2 is set

Details:
  TestName: validateGetStreet2AfterSetStreet2
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the getStreet2 method correctly returns the value that was previously set using the setStreet2 method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class. Use the setStreet2 method to set a known value.
  Act: Call the getStreet2 method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the return value of the getStreet2 method with the value that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion is verifying that the getStreet2 method is correctly returning the value that was set. This is important to ensure that the Address class is correctly storing and retrieving the street2 value.

Scenario 2: Validate getStreet2 method when Street2 is not set

Details:
  TestName: validateGetStreet2WithoutSetStreet2
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the getStreet2 method correctly returns null when the street2 has not been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class without setting street2.
  Act: Call the getStreet2 method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the return value of the getStreet2 method is null.
Validation:
  The assertion is verifying that the getStreet2 method is correctly returning null when the street2 value has not been set. This is important to ensure that the Address class correctly handles the scenario where the street2 value has not been set.

Scenario 3: Validate getStreet2 method when Street2 is set to empty string

Details:
  TestName: validateGetStreet2AfterSetStreet2ToEmptyString
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the getStreet2 method correctly returns an empty string when the street2 has been set to an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class. Use the setStreet2 method to set the street2 to an empty string.
  Act: Call the getStreet2 method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the return value of the getStreet2 method is an empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion is verifying that the getStreet2 method is correctly returning an empty string when the street2 value has been set to an empty string. This is important to ensure that the Address class correctly handles the scenario where the street2 value has been set to an empty string.
