Scenario 1: Test for Valid Street2 Value

Details:
  TestName: testValidStreet2Value.
  Description: This test is designed to check the functionality of the getStreet2() method when a valid street2 value is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an Address object and set a valid street2 value using the setStreet2() method.
  Act: Invoke the getStreet2() method of the Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value from getStreet2() is equal to the set value.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the getStreet2() method correctly retrieves the set street2 value. This is crucial for the application's address management functionality.

Scenario 2: Test for Null Street2 Value

Details:
  TestName: testNullStreet2Value.
  Description: This test is designed to check the functionality of the getStreet2() method when no street2 value is set, i.e., it is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an Address object without setting a street2 value.
  Act: Invoke the getStreet2() method of the Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value from getStreet2() is null.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the getStreet2() method correctly handles a null street2 value. This is crucial for ensuring the robustness of the application's address management functionality.

Scenario 3: Test for Empty Street2 Value

Details:
  TestName: testEmptyStreet2Value.
  Description: This test is designed to check the functionality of the getStreet2() method when an empty string is set as the street2 value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an Address object and set an empty string as the street2 value using the setStreet2() method.
  Act: Invoke the getStreet2() method of the Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value from getStreet2() is an empty string.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the getStreet2() method correctly handles an empty street2 value. This is important for ensuring the application's ability to handle different input scenarios.
