""" 

  Scenario 1: Test to check if getStreet2 returns the correct street2 value

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetStreet2ReturnsCorrectValue
    Description: This test is designed to verify that the getStreet2 method returns the correct street2 value that has been previously set using the setStreet2 method. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set a known value for street2 using the setStreet2 method.
    Act: Invoke the getStreet2 method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against the known value set earlier.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that the getStreet2 method correctly retrieves the value of street2. The expected result is the known value that was set earlier. This test is significant as it confirms that the getStreet2 method is functioning as expected, which is crucial for the application's address management functionality.

  Scenario 2: Test to check if getStreet2 returns null when no value has been set

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetStreet2ReturnsNullWhenNotSet
    Description: This test is designed to verify that the getStreet2 method returns null if no value has been set for street2. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class without setting a value for street2.
    Act: Invoke the getStreet2 method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the returned value is null.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that the getStreet2 method correctly handles the scenario where no value has been set for street2. The expected result is null. This test is significant as it checks the robustness of the getStreet2 method in handling such scenarios, which is important for the stability of the application.

  Scenario 3: Test to check if getStreet2 returns the latest set value

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetStreet2ReturnsLatestSetValue
    Description: This test is designed to verify that the getStreet2 method returns the latest value set for street2 when the value is changed multiple times. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set different values for street2 using the setStreet2 method multiple times.
    Act: Invoke the getStreet2 method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against the latest value set for street2.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that the getStreet2 method correctly retrieves the most recently set value of street2. The expected result is the latest value that was set. This test is significant as it confirms that the getStreet2 method correctly reflects changes to the value of street2, which is crucial for the dynamic nature of the application's address management functionality.
