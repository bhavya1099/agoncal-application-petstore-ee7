  Scenario 1: Test to check if getStreet2 returns the correct value

  Details:
    TestName: testGetStreet2ReturnValue
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getStreet2() function returns the correct value that was previously set using setStreet2().
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address object and set the street2 field using setStreet2().
    Act: Invoke the getStreet2() method on the created object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against the value that was set.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getStreet2() method correctly retrieves the value of the street2 field. The expected result is that the returned value matches the value that was initially set. This test is significant as it ensures that the getter method for street2 is working as expected.

  Scenario 2: Test to check if getStreet2 returns null when not set

  Details:
    TestName: testGetStreet2ReturnNull
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getStreet2() function returns null when the street2 field has not been set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address object without setting the street2 field.
    Act: Invoke the getStreet2() method on the created object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is null.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getStreet2() method returns null when the street2 field has not been set. The expected result is that the returned value is null. This test is significant as it ensures that the getter method for street2 correctly handles the case where the street2 field has not been set.

  Scenario 3: Test to check if getStreet2 returns the correct value after multiple setStreet2 calls

  Details:
    TestName: testGetStreet2AfterMultipleSetStreet2
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getStreet2() function returns the correct value after multiple setStreet2() calls.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address object and set the street2 field multiple times using setStreet2().
    Act: Invoke the getStreet2() method on the created object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against the value that was last set.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getStreet2() method correctly retrieves the value of the street2 field after multiple setStreet2() calls. The expected result is that the returned value matches the value that was last set. This test is significant as it ensures that the getter method for street2 is working as expected even after multiple setStreet2() calls.
