  Scenario 1: Test to check if getStreet2 returns the correct street2 value

  Details:
    TestName: testGetStreet2ReturnsCorrectValue
    Description: This test is designed to verify that the getStreet2 method returns the correct street2 value that has been previously set using the setStreet2 method.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set a known value for street2 using the setStreet2 method.
    Act: Invoke the getStreet2 method on the instance.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value from getStreet2 equals the known value set earlier.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the getStreet2 method retrieves the correct value that was previously set. The expected result is the known value that was set earlier. This is important as it ensures the integrity of data retrieval for the street2 field.

  Scenario 2: Test to check if getStreet2 returns null when no value is set

  Details:
    TestName: testGetStreet2ReturnsNullWhenNoValueSet
    Description: This test is designed to check if the getStreet2 method returns null when no value is set for street2.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class without setting a value for street2.
    Act: Invoke the getStreet2 method on the instance.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value from getStreet2 is null.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the getStreet2 method returns null when no value is set for street2. The expected result is null. This is important as it ensures that the method behaves correctly when no value is set for the street2 field.

  Scenario 3: Test to check if getStreet2 returns the latest set value

  Details:
    TestName: testGetStreet2ReturnsLatestSetValue
    Description: This test is designed to check if the getStreet2 method returns the latest value set for street2 when the value is updated multiple times.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set different values for street2 multiple times.
    Act: Invoke the getStreet2 method on the instance.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value from getStreet2 is equal to the latest set value.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the getStreet2 method retrieves the latest set value for street2. The expected result is the latest set value. This is significant as it ensures that the method correctly updates and retrieves the value of the street2 field.
