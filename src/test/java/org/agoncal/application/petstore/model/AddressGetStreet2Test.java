"""
Scenario 1: Validate the Return of Street2 Value

Details:
  TestName: testGetStreet2ReturnValue.
  Description: This test is designed to validate the correct return value of the getStreet2() method. This test will check if the method returns the expected street2 value after it has been set using the setStreet2 method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set a known value for street2 using the setStreet2 method.
  Act: Invoke the getStreet2 method on the Address instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result of getStreet2 against the expected street2 value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify the correct return value of the getStreet2 method. The expected result is the value that was set using the setStreet2 method. This test is significant as it validates the basic functionality of the getStreet2 method, ensuring that it correctly retrieves the value of street2 from an Address instance.

Scenario 2: Validate the Return of Null Value for Street2

Details:
  TestName: testGetStreet2ReturnNullValue.
  Description: This test is designed to validate that the getStreet2() method correctly returns null when street2 has not been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class without setting a value for street2.
  Act: Invoke the getStreet2 method on the Address instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the return value of getStreet2 is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getStreet2 method returns null when street2 has not been set. This is the expected result as no value has been set for street2 in the Address instance. This test is significant as it ensures the getStreet2 method correctly handles scenarios where street2 is unset.

Scenario 3: Validate the Consistency of Street2 Value

Details:
  TestName: testGetStreet2Consistency.
  Description: This test is designed to validate that the getStreet2() method consistently returns the same value for street2 during multiple invocations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class and set a known value for street2 using the setStreet2 method.
  Act: Invoke the getStreet2 method on the Address instance multiple times.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the return value of getStreet2 is consistent across multiple invocations.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify the consistency of the getStreet2 method. The expected result is that the return value of getStreet2 remains the same across multiple invocations. This test is significant as it ensures the getStreet2 method behaves consistently, which is crucial for the reliable operation of the application.
