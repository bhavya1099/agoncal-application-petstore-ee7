Based on the provided information and the method `getStreet2()`, here are several test scenarios for the Address entity:
```
Scenario 1: Retrieve Street2 Value Successfully
Details:
  TestName: getStreet2Value
  Description: Verify that the getStreet2() method correctly returns the value of street2 when it has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set a value for street2 using the setStreet2() method.
  Act: Call the getStreet2() method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the value that was set.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getStreet2() method correctly retrieves the street2 value that was previously set. It validates the basic functionality of the getter method.
Scenario 2: Retrieve Null Street2 Value
Details:
  TestName: getStreet2NullValue
  Description: Verify that the getStreet2() method returns null when street2 has not been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Address object without setting any values.
  Act: Call the getStreet2() method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  This test checks the behavior of getStreet2() when street2 hasn't been initialized. It's important to ensure that the method handles unset values correctly.
Scenario 3: Retrieve Street2 After Multiple Sets
Details:
  TestName: getStreet2AfterMultipleSets
  Description: Verify that getStreet2() returns the most recent value after multiple setStreet2() calls.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and call setStreet2() multiple times with different values.
  Act: Call the getStreet2() method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the last value set.
Validation:
  This test ensures that getStreet2() always returns the most recent value, validating that the setter correctly updates the street2 field.
Scenario 4: Verify Street2 in toString Method
Details:
  TestName: verifyStreet2InToString
  Description: Ensure that the street2 value is correctly included in the string representation of the Address object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and set a value for street2.
  Act: Call the toString() method on the Address object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned string contains the street2 value.
Validation:
  This test checks if the street2 value is properly represented in the string output of the Address object, ensuring consistency in object representation.
Scenario 5: Verify Street2 Not Used in Equals Method
Details:
  TestName: verifyStreet2NotUsedInEquals
  Description: Confirm that the street2 value does not affect the equality comparison of Address objects.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with the same values for street1, city, and zipcode, but different street2 values.
  Act: Compare the two objects using the equals() method.
  Assert: Verify that the objects are considered equal despite having different street2 values.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the equals() method implementation correctly ignores the street2 field, as per the provided equals() method implementation.
```
These scenarios cover various aspects of the `getStreet2()` method and its interaction with other parts of the Address entity. They test the basic functionality, edge cases, and how it relates to other methods in the class.
