    This assertion aims to verify that the default value of street2 is null. This test is significant as it checks the initial state of the Address object.

  Scenario 2: Test to verify setting and getting of street2

  Details:  
    TestName: testSetAndGetStreet2
    Description: This test is meant to check the setStreet2 and getStreet2 methods by setting a value to street2 and then getting it. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new Address object, and set a value to street2.
    Act: Invoke the getStreet2 method.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the value set to street2.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that the getStreet2 method returns the correct value that was set. This test is significant as it checks the functionality of setStreet2 and getStreet2 methods.

  Scenario 3: Test to verify the returned value of street2 after changing its value

  Details:  
    TestName: testChangeStreet2Value
    Description: This test is meant to check the getStreet2 method after changing the value of street2. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new Address object, set a value to street2, then change the value of street2.
    Act: Invoke the getStreet2 method.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the new value set to street2.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that the getStreet2 method returns the updated value of street2. This test is significant as it checks the functionality of setStreet2 and getStreet2 methods after update.

  Scenario 4: Test to verify the returned value of street2 when its value is an empty string

  Details:  
    TestName: testEmptyStreet2Value
    Description: This test is meant to check the getStreet2 method when the value of street2 is an empty string. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new Address object, and set an empty string to street2.
    Act: Invoke the getStreet2 method.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is an empty string.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that the getStreet2 method returns an empty string when street2 is set to an empty string. This test is significant as it checks the functionality of setStreet2 and getStreet2 methods with different input values.
