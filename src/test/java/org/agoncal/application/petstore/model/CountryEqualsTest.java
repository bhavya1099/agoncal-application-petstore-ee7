### Test Scenario 1: Equal Countries

Details:
  TestName: checkEqualCountries
  Description: This test verifies if the equals method returns true when two country objects have the same isoCode.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Country objects with the same isoCode value.
  Act: Call the equals method on one of the Country objects, passing the other as an argument.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the result is true.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. The assertion checks that two objects with identical isoCodes are considered equal by the method, validating the primary functionality of the equals method.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic. Ensuring that identical entities are recognized as such helps maintain data integrity and consistency across operations that rely on entity comparison.


### Test Scenario 2: Unequal Countries

Details:
  TestName: checkUnequalCountries
  Description: This test verifies if the equals method returns false when two country objects have different isoCodes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Country objects, each with a different isoCode.
  Act: Call the equals method on one of the Country objects, passing the other as an argument.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the result is false.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. The assertion verifies that two objects with different isoCodes are not considered equal, which is crucial for accurate entity distinction and proper handling in collections like Sets or Maps where equality plays a key role.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic. Correct differentiation between different entities prevents incorrect data manipulation and ensures that each unique entity is treated appropriately.


### Test Scenario 3: Comparison with Null

Details:
  TestName: checkEqualityWithNull
  Description: This test ensures that the equals method returns false when it is compared with a null reference.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create one Country object. No need to create a null object explicitly as null is a literal.
  Act: Call the equals method on the Country object, passing null as the argument.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the result is false.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. It verifies that the method correctly identifies and returns false when comparing any Country object with null, safeguarding against potential NullPointerExceptions.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic. Proper handling of null values in equality checks is essential for robust application functioning and avoiding crashes due to unhandled exceptions.


### Test Scenario 4: Comparison with Non-Country Object

Details:
  TestName: checkEqualityWithDifferentClass
  Description: This test ensures that the equals method returns false when a Country object is compared to an object of a different class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Country object and a String object or any other object that is not an instance of the Country class.
  Act: Call the equals method on the Country object, passing the non-Country object as an argument.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the result is false.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. This test confirms that the equals method properly checks for object type compatibility before comparing further, aligning with good encapsulation and type safety practices.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic. Ensuring type safety in comparisons helps prevent runtime errors and ensures that each typeâ€™s specific logic is accurately applied.
