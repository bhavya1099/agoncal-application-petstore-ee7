Based on the provided method and class information, here are several test scenarios for the `equals` method of the `Country` class:
Scenario 1: Equal Countries with Same ISO Code
Details:
  TestName: equalCountriesWithSameIsoCode
  Description: Verify that two Country objects with the same ISO code are considered equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Country objects with the same ISO code but different values for other fields.
  Act: Call the equals method on one object, passing the other as an argument.
  Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the equals method correctly identifies two Country objects as equal based solely on their ISO code, regardless of other field values. This is crucial for ensuring that the equality check is based on the business key (ISO code) and not on other properties.
Scenario 2: Unequal Countries with Different ISO Codes
Details:
  TestName: unequalCountriesWithDifferentIsoCodes
  Description: Verify that two Country objects with different ISO codes are not considered equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Country objects with different ISO codes.
  Act: Call the equals method on one object, passing the other as an argument.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the equals method correctly differentiates between Country objects based on their ISO codes. It's important for maintaining the integrity of country identification in the system.
Scenario 3: Country Compared to Null
Details:
  TestName: countryComparedToNull
  Description: Verify that a Country object is not equal to null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Country object.
  Act: Call the equals method on the Country object, passing null as an argument.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  This test checks the null handling in the equals method, which is a crucial part of a robust equals implementation. It ensures that the method doesn't throw a NullPointerException and correctly handles null comparisons.
Scenario 4: Country Compared to Different Object Type
Details:
  TestName: countryComparedToDifferentObjectType
  Description: Verify that a Country object is not equal to an object of a different type.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Country object and an object of a different type (e.g., a String).
  Act: Call the equals method on the Country object, passing the different object as an argument.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the equals method correctly handles comparisons with objects of different types. It's important for type safety and preventing unexpected behavior when comparing objects in collections or other contexts.
Scenario 5: Country Compared to Itself
Details:
  TestName: countryComparedToItself
  Description: Verify that a Country object is equal to itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Country object.
  Act: Call the equals method on the Country object, passing itself as an argument.
  Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation:
  This test checks the reflexivity property of the equals method, which is one of the general contracts for the equals operation. It ensures that an object is always equal to itself, which is important for consistency in various operations and data structures.
Scenario 6: Countries with Null ISO Codes
Details:
  TestName: countriesWithNullIsoCodes
  Description: Verify the behavior of equals method when comparing Countries with null ISO codes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Country objects with null ISO codes.
  Act: Call the equals method on one object, passing the other as an argument.
  Assert: Assert that the result matches the expected behavior (which may throw a NullPointerException or return false, depending on the implementation).
Validation:
  This test checks how the equals method handles null ISO codes. It's important to verify the robustness of the method in handling potential null values, especially since the ISO code is the key field for equality.
These scenarios cover various aspects of the equals method, including normal cases, edge cases, and potential error conditions. They help ensure that the method behaves correctly under different circumstances and maintains the contract of the equals operation.
