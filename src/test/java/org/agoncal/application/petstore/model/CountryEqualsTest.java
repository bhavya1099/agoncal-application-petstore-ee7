```
Scenario 1: Test the equality of two Country objects with identical ISO codes

Details:
  TestName: testEqualityWithSameIsoCode
  Description: This test checks that the equals method correctly identifies two Country objects as equal when they have the same ISO code, regardless of other attributes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Country objects with the same ISO code but different names and other attributes.
  Act: Call the equals method on one of the Country objects, passing the other as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is true.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify – that two countries with identical ISO codes are considered equal, as per the business logic defined in the equals method.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test – to ensure the application correctly identifies countries as identical when their ISO codes match, which is crucial for operations depending on unique country identification based on ISO codes.

Scenario 2: Test the inequality of two Country objects with different ISO codes

Details:
  TestName: testInequalityWithDifferentIsoCode
  Description: This test confirms that the equals method correctly identifies two Country objects as not equal when their ISO codes are different.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Country objects, each with a different ISO code.
  Act: Call the equals method on one of the Country objects, passing the other as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify – that two countries with different ISO codes are considered not equal, aligning with the implementation of the equals method.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test – to validate that the application can accurately distinguish countries based on ISO codes, which is vital for operations like data segregation, uniqueness validation, etc.

Scenario 3: Test the equality of a Country object with itself

Details:
  TestName: testEqualityWithSelf
  Description: This test checks that the equals method returns true when a Country object is compared with itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Country object.
  Act: Call the equals method on this Country object, passing itself as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is true.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify – that a country is always considered equal to itself, ensuring that the equals method adheres to the reflexive property required of an equivalence relation.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test – to ensure stable behavior of sets or maps that might contain these objects, preventing logical errors in identity comparisons.

Scenario 4: Test the inequality of a Country object compared to null

Details:
  TestName: testInequalityWithNull
  Description: This test assesses that the equals method should return false when a Country object is compared to a null reference.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Country object.
  Act: Call the equals method on this Country object, passing null as the argument.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify – that any country object is not considered equal to null, which ensures that the equals method handles null inputs gracefully.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test – prevents NullPointerExceptions and ensures that collections containing Country objects can properly handle null checks.
