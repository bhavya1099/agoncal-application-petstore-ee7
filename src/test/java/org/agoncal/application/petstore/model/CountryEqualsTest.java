Scenario 1: Test the equals method when both countries are the same
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithSameCountry.
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies when two countries are the same.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two country objects with the same isoCode.
  Act: Invoke the equals method by comparing the two country objects.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies when two countries are the same. This is important to ensure that the system correctly identifies a country based on its isoCode.

Scenario 2: Test the equals method when the countries are different
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentCountries.
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies when two countries are different.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two country objects with different isoCodes.
  Act: Invoke the equals method by comparing the two country objects.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies when two countries are different. This is essential to ensure that the system correctly distinguishes between countries based on their isoCodes.

Scenario 3: Test the equals method when one country is null
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithNullCountry.
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly handles when one of the countries is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a country object and a null object.
  Act: Invoke the equals method by comparing the country object with the null object.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly handles null objects. This is important to prevent null pointer exceptions and ensure the correct functioning of the system.

Scenario 4: Test the equals method when both countries have null isoCodes
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithNullIsoCodes.
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly handles when both countries have null isoCodes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two country objects with null isoCodes.
  Act: Invoke the equals method by comparing the two country objects.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly handles countries with null isoCodes. This is important to ensure that the system correctly identifies a country even if the isoCode is null.

Scenario 5: Test the equals method when one country has a null isoCode
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithOneNullIsoCode.
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly handles when one country has a null isoCode.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two country objects where one has a null isoCode.
  Act: Invoke the equals method by comparing the two country objects.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly handles a country with a null isoCode. This is important to ensure that the system correctly identifies a country even if one isoCode is null.
