"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if the equals method returns true when comparing the same object
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsMethodForSameObject
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when the same object is compared with itself. As per the equals method implementation, it should return true.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Country object and set the isoCode.
    Act: Invoke the equals method by passing the same object as a parameter.
    Assert: Check if the result is true.
  Validation:
    The expectation is that the equals method should return true when the same object is compared with itself. This is a basic test to validate the equals method functionality.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the equals method returns false when the object is null
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsMethodForNullObject
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when the object compared is null. According to the equals method implementation, it should return false.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Country object and set the isoCode.
    Act: Invoke the equals method by passing null as a parameter.
    Assert: Check if the result is false.
  Validation:
    The expectation is that the equals method should return false when null is compared. This test is crucial to validate the null check in the equals method.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the equals method returns false when objects are of different classes
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsMethodForDifferentClassObjects
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when the object compared is of a different class. According to the equals method implementation, it should return false.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Country object and set the isoCode. Create an object of a different class.
    Act: Invoke the equals method by passing the different class object as a parameter.
    Assert: Check if the result is false.
  Validation:
    The expectation is that the equals method should return false when objects of different classes are compared. This test is essential to validate the class check in the equals method.

Scenario 4: Test to check if the equals method returns true when two objects have the same isoCode
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsMethodForSameIsoCode
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when two Country objects have the same isoCode. According to the equals method implementation, it should return true.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two Country objects and set the same isoCode for both.
    Act: Invoke the equals method by passing the second Country object as a parameter to the first.
    Assert: Check if the result is true.
  Validation:
    The expectation is that the equals method should return true when two Country objects have the same isoCode. This test is crucial to validate the isoCode comparison in the equals method.

Scenario 5: Test to check if the equals method returns false when two objects have different isoCodes
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsMethodForDifferentIsoCode
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when two Country objects have different isoCodes. According to the equals method implementation, it should return false.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two Country objects and set different isoCodes for both.
    Act: Invoke the equals method by passing the second Country object as a parameter to the first.
    Assert: Check if the result is false.
  Validation:
    The expectation is that the equals method should return false when two Country objects have different isoCodes. This test is crucial to validate the isoCode comparison in the equals method.
