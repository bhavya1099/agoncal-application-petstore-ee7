Based on the provided information and the equals method in the Country entity, here are several test scenarios for the equals method:
Scenario 1: Equal Countries with Same ISO Code
Details:
  TestName: equalCountriesWithSameIsoCode
  Description: Verify that two Country objects with the same ISO code are considered equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Country objects with the same ISO code but different names.
  Act: Compare the two Country objects using the equals method.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns true.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the equals method correctly identifies two Country objects as equal based solely on their ISO code, regardless of other attributes. It's crucial for ensuring proper comparison in collections or when using Country objects as keys in maps.
Scenario 2: Unequal Countries with Different ISO Codes
Details:
  TestName: unequalCountriesWithDifferentIsoCodes
  Description: Verify that two Country objects with different ISO codes are not considered equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Country objects with different ISO codes.
  Act: Compare the two Country objects using the equals method.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the equals method correctly differentiates between Country objects based on their ISO codes. It's important for maintaining the integrity of country-based operations and data structures.
Scenario 3: Country Compared to Itself
Details:
  TestName: countryComparedToItself
  Description: Verify that a Country object is equal to itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a single Country object.
  Act: Compare the Country object to itself using the equals method.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns true.
Validation:
  This test checks the reflexive property of the equals method, which is a fundamental contract of the equals operation. It ensures consistency in object comparison.
Scenario 4: Country Compared to Null
Details:
  TestName: countryComparedToNull
  Description: Verify that a Country object is not equal to null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Country object.
  Act: Compare the Country object to null using the equals method.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the equals method correctly handles null comparisons, which is crucial for preventing null pointer exceptions and maintaining robustness in equality checks.
Scenario 5: Country Compared to Different Object Type
Details:
  TestName: countryComparedToDifferentObjectType
  Description: Verify that a Country object is not equal to an object of a different type.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Country object and an object of a different type (e.g., a String).
  Act: Compare the Country object to the different object using the equals method.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the equals method correctly handles comparisons with objects of different types, maintaining type safety in equality checks.
Scenario 6: Countries with Null ISO Codes
Details:
  TestName: countriesWithNullIsoCodes
  Description: Verify the behavior of equals method when comparing Countries with null ISO codes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Country objects with null ISO codes.
  Act: Compare the two Country objects using the equals method.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method throws a NullPointerException.
Validation:
  This test checks how the equals method handles null ISO codes. It's important to verify if the method properly handles this edge case, either by throwing an exception or handling it gracefully.
These scenarios cover various aspects of the equals method, including normal cases, edge cases, and potential error conditions, providing a comprehensive test suite for the method.
