  Scenario 1: Test Scenario to Validate Street2 with a Valid String
  Details:
    TestName: testSetStreet2WithValidString
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the setStreet2 method when provided with a valid string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the class, set a valid string as the method parameter.
    Act: Invoke the setStreet2 method with the valid string.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual value of street2 with the expected value.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the setStreet2 method correctly sets the value of street2. The expected result is the value provided as a parameter. This test is significant as it ensures that the method correctly updates the street2 field with valid inputs.
  Scenario 2: Test Scenario to Validate Street2 with Null String
  Details:
    TestName: testSetStreet2WithNullString
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the setStreet2 method when provided with a null string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the class, set a null string as the method parameter.
    Act: Invoke the setStreet2 method with the null string.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual value of street2 with the expected value (null).
  Validation:
    The assertion is to verify that the setStreet2 method correctly sets the value of street2 as null when provided with a null string. This test is significant as it ensures that the method can handle null values correctly.
  Scenario 3: Test Scenario to Validate Street2 with an Empty String
  Details:
    TestName: testSetStreet2WithEmptyString
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the setStreet2 method when provided with an empty string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the class, set an empty string as the method parameter.
    Act: Invoke the setStreet2 method with the empty string.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual value of street2 with the expected value (empty string).
  Validation:
    The assertion is to verify that the setStreet2 method correctly sets the value of street2 as an empty string when provided with an empty string. This test is significant as it ensures that the method can handle empty strings correctly.

  Scenario 4: Test Scenario to Validate Street2 with a Long String
  Details:
    TestName: testSetStreet2WithLongString
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the setStreet2 method when provided with a long string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the class, set a long string as the method parameter.
    Act: Invoke the setStreet2 method with the long string.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual value of street2 with the expected value (long string).
  Validation:
    The assertion is to verify that the setStreet2 method correctly sets the value of street2 as the long string when provided with a long string. This test is significant as it ensures that the method can handle long strings correctly.
