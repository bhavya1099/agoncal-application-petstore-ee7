ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=setStreet2_1a0c458934
Scenario 1: Test Setting Valid Street2  
Details:  
  TestName: testSettingValidStreet2  
  Description: This test is meant to check if the setter method for street2 is working correctly when provided with a valid input.   
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid string for street2.
  Act: Invoke the setStreet2 method with the valid string.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertion to check if street2 is successfully set.
Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify that the setStreet2 method correctly sets a valid value. A successful test is significant in the context of ensuring data integrity and correct behavior when manipulating object fields.
Scenario 2: Setting Null Value to Street2
Details:  
  TestName: testSettingNullStreet2  
  Description: This test is designed to validate how the setStreet2 method handles null values.   
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the parameter of setStreet2 method to null. 
  Act: Invoke the setStreet2 method with null.
  Assert: Check if the value of street2 is null. 
Validation: 
  This aims to verify that the method can handle null inputs and won't throw a NullPointerException. The expected result is important because handling null values gracefully is integral to robust software design.
Scenario 3: Setting Empty String to Street2
Details:  
  TestName: testSettingEmptyStreet2  
  Description: This test is meant to check the setStreet2 method's behavior when it is supplied with an empty string as input.   
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the parameter of setStreet2 method to an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the setStreet2 method with an empty string.
  Assert: Check if the value of street2 is an empty string.
Validation: 
  This assertion will verify if the setStreet2 function correctly handles empty string inputs. The expected result is pivotal for application behavior validation to ensure no unexpected issues can arise from an empty string as input.
Scenario 4: Setting a Really Long String to Street2
Details:  
  TestName: testSettingLongStringStreet2
  Description: This test determines the behavior of the setStreet2 method when a string with a length exceeding the normal/expected range is provided.  
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a very long string for street2.
  Act: Invoke the setStreet2 method with this long string. 
  Assert: Check if the value of street2 is the very long string. 
Validation: 
  This aims to verify the system's ability to handle unusual edge cases. The expected result signifies that street2 can accommodate a string of any length without negative effects on system functionality.
