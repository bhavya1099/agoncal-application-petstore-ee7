Here are the test scenarios for the `setStreet2` method:
Scenario 1: Setting a valid street2 address
Details:
  TestName: setValidStreet2Address
  Description: This test aims to verify that the `setStreet2` method correctly updates the `street2` field with a valid address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set `street1`, `city`, `state`, `zipcode`, and `country` to valid values.
  Act: Call the `setStreet2` method with a valid street2 address.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the `street2` field has been updated correctly.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the `street2` field is updated correctly when a valid address is provided. This is significant because it ensures that the method behaves as expected when valid input is provided. It also ensures that the `street2` field is correctly updated, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of the address data.
Scenario 2: Setting an empty street2 address
Details:
  TestName: setEmptyStreet2Address
  Description: This test aims to verify that the `setStreet2` method correctly handles an empty street2 address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set `street1`, `city`, `state`, `zipcode`, and `country` to valid values.
  Act: Call the `setStreet2` method with an empty string.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the `street2` field is set to an empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the `street2` field is set to an empty string when an empty address is provided. This is significant because it ensures that the method behaves as expected when invalid input is provided. It also ensures that the `street2` field is correctly updated, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of the address data.
Scenario 3: Setting a null street2 address
Details:
  TestName: setNullStreet2Address
  Description: This test aims to verify that the `setStreet2` method correctly handles a null street2 address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set `street1`, `city`, `state`, `zipcode`, and `country` to valid values.
  Act: Call the `setStreet2` method with a null value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the `street2` field is set to null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the `street2` field is set to null when a null address is provided. This is significant because it ensures that the method behaves as expected when invalid input is provided. It also ensures that the `street2` field is correctly updated, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of the address data.
Scenario 4: Setting a street2 address with leading/trailing whitespace
Details:
  TestName: setStreet2AddressWithWhitespace
  Description: This test aims to verify that the `setStreet2` method correctly handles a street2 address with leading/trailing whitespace.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set `street1`, `city`, `state`, `zipcode`, and `country` to valid values.
  Act: Call the `setStreet2` method with a street2 address that has leading/trailing whitespace.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the `street2` field is set to the trimmed address.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the `street2` field is set to the trimmed address when a street2 address with leading/trailing whitespace is provided. This is significant because it ensures that the method behaves as expected when invalid input is provided. It also ensures that the `street2` field is correctly updated, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of the address data.
Scenario 5: Setting a street2 address that exceeds the maximum allowed length
Details:
  TestName: setStreet2AddressExceedsMaxLength
  Description: This test aims to verify that the `setStreet2` method correctly handles a street2 address that exceeds the maximum allowed length.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set `street1`, `city`, `state`, `zipcode`, and `country` to valid values.
  Act: Call the `setStreet2` method with a street2 address that exceeds the maximum allowed length.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the `street2` field is set to the truncated address.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the `street2` field is set to the truncated address when a street2 address that exceeds the maximum allowed length is provided. This is significant because it ensures that the method behaves as expected when invalid input is provided. It also ensures that the `street2` field is correctly updated, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of the address data.
Note: The maximum allowed length for the `street2` field can be obtained from the `@Size` annotation on the `street2` field.
