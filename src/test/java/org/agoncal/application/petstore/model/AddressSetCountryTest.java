Here are the test scenarios for the `setCountry` method:
**Scenario 1: Setting a valid Country object**
TestName: testSetCountryValidObject
Description: Verifies that the `setCountry` method sets the country field with a valid `Country` object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new `Country` object with valid data.
  Act: Call the `setCountry` method with the created `Country` object.
  Assert: Use `assertThat` to verify that the country field is set with the expected `Country` object.
Validation: This test ensures that the method correctly sets the country field with a valid object, which is a basic functionality of the method.
**Scenario 2: Setting a null Country object**
TestName: testSetCountryNullObject
Description: Verifies that the `setCountry` method handles a null `Country` object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the `Country` object to null.
  Act: Call the `setCountry` method with the null `Country` object.
  Assert: Use `assertNull` to verify that the country field is set to null.
Validation: This test ensures that the method handles null inputs correctly, which is an important aspect of error handling.
**Scenario 3: Setting the same Country object multiple times**
TestName: testSetCountrySameObjectMultipleTimes
Description: Verifies that the `setCountry` method can set the same `Country` object multiple times without issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new `Country` object and set it as the country field.
  Act: Call the `setCountry` method with the same `Country` object multiple times.
  Assert: Use `assertThat` to verify that the country field is set with the expected `Country` object after each call.
Validation: This test ensures that the method can handle repeated calls with the same object, which is a common use case.
**Scenario 4: Setting a different Country object**
TestName: testSetCountryDifferentObject
Description: Verifies that the `setCountry` method can set a different `Country` object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two different `Country` objects.
  Act: Call the `setCountry` method with the first `Country` object, and then call it again with the second `Country` object.
  Assert: Use `assertThat` to verify that the country field is set with the expected `Country` object after each call.
Validation: This test ensures that the method can handle setting different objects, which is a fundamental functionality.
**Scenario 5: Setting a Country object with cascading relationships**
TestName: testSetCountryCascadingRelationships
Description: Verifies that the `setCountry` method handles cascading relationships with other objects.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a `Country` object with a cascading relationship (e.g., a `State` object).
  Act: Call the `setCountry` method with the `Country` object.
  Assert: Use `assertThat` to verify that the cascading relationship is correctly set.
Validation: This test ensures that the method handles complex relationships with other objects, which is an important aspect of the application's behavior.
These test scenarios cover various aspects of the `setCountry` method, including valid and null inputs, repeated calls, and cascading relationships.
