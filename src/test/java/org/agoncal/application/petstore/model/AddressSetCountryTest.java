```
Scenario 1: Set a valid country to the address
Details:
  TestName: setValidCountry
  Description: This test checks if the setCountry method correctly assigns a valid Country object to the address entity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address and a valid Country object.
  Act: Call setCountry method on the Address instance with the valid Country object.
  Assert: Use an assertion to check if getCountry method returns the Country object that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the country field in the Address instance holds the correct Country object. This is crucial for maintaining correct address records and ensuring that related operations such as formatting or validation of addresses can be executed correctly.
Scenario 2: Set a null country to the address
Details:
  TestName: setNullCountry
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the setCountry method when a null value is passed, ensuring that the method can handle null inputs without causing errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address.
  Act: Call setCountry method on the Address instance with null.
  Assert: Use an assertion to check if getCountry method returns null.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the country field is set to null when a null Country object is passed. This test is significant to verify the robustness of the setCountry method, ensuring it handles null inputs gracefully, potentially avoiding runtime exceptions.
Scenario 3: Set a new country when a different country is already set
Details:
  TestName: changeCountry
  Description: This test ensures that the setCountry method can update the country field in the Address instance when a different Country object is set compared to the existing one.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address and set an initial Country object. Create a different Country object to update.
  Act: Call setCountry method on the Address instance with the new Country object.
  Assert: Use an assertion to check if getCountry method returns the new Country object.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the country field is updated correctly with the new Country object. This test is essential to ensure that the address records can be updated accurately, reflecting changes such as migration or correction of earlier mistakes.
Scenario 4: Repeatedly setting the same country object
Details:
  TestName: setSameCountryMultipleTimes
  Description: This test checks the idempotence of the setCountry method by setting the same Country object multiple times and verifying that the state of the Address object remains consistent.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address and a Country object. Set this Country object to the Address.
  Act: Call setCountry method on the Address instance with the same Country object multiple times.
  Assert: Use an assertion to check if getCountry method returns the same Country object and that subsequent calls do not alter the outcome.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that multiple calls with the same parameter do not affect the state of the Address object. This is significant for ensuring the stability and predictability of the setCountry method's behavior.
